2003.06730v1,2020-03-15,2020-03-15,The Asymptotic Iteration Method Revisited,"  The Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) is a technique for solving analytically
and approximately the linear second-order differential equation, especially the
eigenvalue problems that frequently appear in theoretical and mathematical
physics. The analysis and mathematical justifications of the success and
failure of the asymptotic iteration method are detailed in this work. A theorem
explaining why the asymptotic iteration method works for the eigenvalue problem
is presented. As a byproduct, a new procedure to generate unlimited classes of
exactly solvable differential equations is also introduced.

2003.06842v1,2020-03-15,2020-03-15,An imaging line survey of OMC-1 to OMC-3,"  Aims: Our aim is to identify the dominant molecular cooling lines and
characteristic emission features in the 1.3 mm window of distinct regions in
the northern part of the Orion A molecular cloud. By defining and analysing
template regions, we also intend to help with the interpretation of
observations from more distant sources which cannot be easily spatially
resolved.
  Methods: We analyse an imaging line survey covering the area of OMC-1 to
OMC-3 from 200.2 to 281.8 GHz obtained with the PI230 receiver at the APEX
telescope. Masks are used to define regions with distinct properties (e.g.
column density or temperature ranges) from which we obtain averaged spectra.
Lines of 29 molecular species (55 isotopologues) are fitted for each region to
obtain the respective total intensity.
  Results: We find that strong sources like Orion KL have a clear impact on the
emission on larger scales. Although not spatially extended, their line emission
contributes substantially to spectra averaged over large regions. Conversely,
the emission signatures of dense, cold regions like OMC-2 and OMC-3 (e.g.
enhanced N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission and low HCN/HNC ratio) seem to be difficult to
pick up on larger scales, where they are eclipsed by signatures of stronger
sources. In all regions, HCO$^{+}$ appears to contribute between 3% and 6% to
the total intensity, the most stable value for all bright species.
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ shows the strongest correlation with column density, but not
with typical high-density tracers like HCN, HCO$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, or HNC.
Common line ratios associated with UV illumination, CN/HNC and CN/HCO$^{+}$,
show ambiguous results on larger scales, suggesting that the identification of
UV illuminated material may be more challenging. The HCN/HNC ratio may be
related to temperature over varying scales.

into its canonical form, up to relative phases, given many copies of the
original state. The circuit is made of three single-qubit parametrized quantum
gates, and the optimal values for the parameters are learned in a variational

which quantifies genuine tripartite entanglement. We perform simulations on a
set of random states under different noise conditions to asses the validity of
the method.

  matter-waves","  Transient phenomena of phase modulated cut-off wavepackets are explored by
deriving an exact general solution to Schr\""odinger's equation for finite range
potentials involving arbitrary initial quantum states. We show that the
dynamical features of the probability density are governed by a virtual
\textit{self-induced two-level system} with energies $E_{+}$, and $E_{-}$, due
to the phase modulation of the initial state. The asymptotic probability
density exhibits Rabi-oscillations characterized by a frequency
$\Omega=(E_{+}-E_{-})/\hbar$, which are independent of the potential profile.
It is also found that for a system with a bound state, the interplay between
the virtual levels with the latter causes a \textit{quantum beat} effect with a
beating frequency, $\Omega$. We also find a regime characterized by a
\textit{time-diffraction} phenomenon that allows to measure unambiguously the
delay-time, which can be described by an exact analytical formula. It is found
that the delay-time agrees with the phase-time only for the case of strictly
monochromatic waves.

the harmonic oscillator. The obtained results of the excitation energies and

dependent mass parameter on energy spectra and transition rates in both cases,
namely: when the mass coefficients are different and when they are equal.
Besides, we will show the positive effect of the present formalism on the
moment of inertia.

  skyrmions by uniaxial-strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya
  interactions","  Magnetic skyrmions in chiral-lattice ferromagnets are currently attracting
enormous research interest because of their potential applications in
spintronic devices. However, they emerge in bulk specimens only in a narrow
window of temperature and magnetic field. This limited stability regime is
recognized as an obstacle to technical applications. Recent experiments
demonstrated that the thermodynamic stability of magnetic skyrmions is enhanced
or suppressed by the application of a uniaxial strain depending on its axial
direction in bulk chiral-lattice ferromagnets MnSi [Y. Nii et al., Nat. Commun.
6, 8539 (2015), A. Chacon et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 267202 (2015)] and
Cu2OSeO3 [S. Seki et al., Phys. Rev. B 96, 220404(R) (2017)]. Motivated by
these experimental discoveries, we theoretically investigated the effects of
anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions on the stability of magnetic
skyrmions caused by this uniaxial strain. We find that magnetic skyrmions are
significantly stabilized (destabilized) in the presence of anisotropic DM
interactions when an external magnetic field lies perpendicular (parallel) to
the anisotropy axis, along which the DM coupling is strengthened. Our results
account completely for the experimentally observed strain-induced stabilization
and destabilization of magnetic skyrmions and provide a firm ground for
possible strain engineering of skyrmion-based electronic devices.

2003.07090v1,2020-03-16,2020-03-16,180$^\circ$ Rotations in the Polarization Angle for Blazars,"  Rotations of the electric vector position angle (EVPA) in blazars are often
close to an integral multiple of 180$^\circ$. There are multiple examples of
this in the literature, and our analysis here, of the optical polarization data
from the RoboPol monitoring program, strengthens the evidence by showing that
$n\pi$ rotations occur more frequently than expected by chance. We explain this
with a model consisting of two polarized emission components: a ""jet"" that is
constant in time, and a ""burst"" that is variable. The EVPA of the combination
is $\rm EVPA_{jet}$ at both the beginning and the end of the burst, so the net
rotation across the burst must be $n\pi$. Examples are analyzed on the Stokes
plane, where the winding number for the Stokes vector of the combination gives
the value of $n$. The main conclusion is that the EVPA rotation can be much
larger than the physical rotation of the emission region around the axis of the
jet, but this requires the EVPAs of the jet and the burst to be nearly
orthogonal. A shock-in-jet calculation by Zhang et al. can provide a physical
model for our toy model, and in addition automatically gives the needed
orthogonality. The model is illustrated with data on OJ287 published by
Myserlis et al., and we suggest that the large rapid EVPA rotation seen there
might be a phase effect and not representative of a physical rotation.

Here, we investigate a model for a single ideal circle swimmer exploring a

moves on circular orbits in the freely accessible space and follows the surface
of an obstacle for a certain time upon collision. Depending on the obstacle
density and the radius of the circular orbits, the microswimmer displays either
long-range transport or is localized in a finite region. We show that there are
transitions from two localized states to a diffusive state each driven by an
underlying static percolation transition. We determine the non-equilibrium
state diagram and calculate the mean-square displacements and diffusivities by
computer simulations. Close to the transition lines transport becomes
subdiffusive which is rationalized as a dynamic critical phenomenon.

varies from ~2 $\times$ 10$^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$ at the edge of the cloud to ~1

visually bright to ground observers, and the initial Starlinks are naked eye
objects. I model the expected number of illuminated satellites as a function of
latitude, time of year, and time of night and summarize the range of possible
consequences for ground-based astronomy. In winter at lower latitudes typical
of major observatories, the satellites will not be illuminated for six hours in
the middle of the night. However, at low elevations near twilight at
intermediate latitudes (45-55 deg, e.g. much of Europe) hundreds of satellites
may be visible at once to naked-eye observers at dark sites.

  color diversity of outer solar system objects","  Reddish coloration and color diversity among icy bodies in the outer solar
system are one of the significant clues for understanding the status and
history of the solar system. However, the origin of color distribution remains
debatable. Here, we demonstrate reddish coloration that is stable only at
cryogenic temperatures in a laboratory experiment. The reddish coloration was
produced on methanol- and water-containing ice irradiated with
nitrogen-containing cryoplasma at 85 K. The reddish color visually faded and
disappeared at 120-150 K as the ice was heated, unlike well-known refractory
organic tholins that are stable even when heated to room temperature. This
temperature dependence of reddish coloration under cryogenic conditions could
provide a new possible explanation for the absence of ultra-red coloration
closer to the Sun in the outer solar system. Our result implies that a reddish
material specific to cryogenic environments is useful for the investigation of
color diversity and formation mechanism of the outer solar system.

  Characteristics: An Analysis of Vehicle Trajectory Data","  Being one of the most promising applications enabled by connected and
automated vehicles (CAV) technology, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)
is expected to be deployed in the near term on public roads.} Thus far, the
majority of the CACC studies have been focusing on the overall network
performance with limited insights on the potential impacts of CAVs on
human-driven vehicles (HVs).This paper aims to quantify such impacts by
studying the high-resolution vehicle trajectory data that are obtained from
microscopic simulation. Two platoon clustering strategies for CACC- an ad hoc
coordination strategy and a local coordination strategy-are implemented.
Results show that the local coordination outperforms the ad hoc coordination
across all tested market penetration rates (MPRs) in terms of network
throughput and productivity. According to the two-sample
Kolmogorov-\textcolor{re}{Smirnov} test, however, the distributions of the hard
braking events (as a potential safety impact) for HVs change significantly
under local coordination strategy. For both of the clustering strategy, CAVs
increase the average lane change frequency for HVs. The break-even point for
average lane change frequency between the two strategies is observed at 30%
MPR, which decreases from 5.42 to 5.38 per vehicle. The average lane change
frequency following a monotonically increasing pattern in response to MPR, and
it reaches the highest 5.48 per vehicle at 40% MPR. Lastly, the interaction
state of the car-following model for HVs is analyzed. It is revealed that the
composition of the interaction state could be influenced by CAVs as well. One
of the apparent trends is that the time spent on approaching state declines
with the increasing presence of CAVs.

  and activity indicators from cross-correlation functions with weighted binary
  masks","  For years, the standard procedure to measure radial velocities (RVs) of
spectral observations consisted in cross-correlating the spectra with a binary
mask, that is, a simple stellar template that contains information on the
position and strength of stellar absorption lines. The cross-correlation
function (CCF) profiles also provide several indicators of stellar activity. We
present a methodology to first build weighted binary masks and, second, to
compute the CCF of spectral observations with these masks from which we derive
radial velocities and activity indicators. These methods are implemented in a
python code that is publicly available. To build the masks, we selected a large
number of sharp absorption lines based on the profile of the minima present in
high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectrum templates built from observations of
reference stars. We computed the CCFs of observed spectra and derived RVs and
the following three standard activity indicators: full-width-at-half-maximum as
well as contrast and bisector inverse slope.We applied our methodology to
CARMENES high-resolution spectra and obtain RV and activity indicator time
series of more than 300 M dwarf stars observed for the main CARMENES survey.
Compared with the standard CARMENES template matching pipeline, in general we
obtain more precise RVs in the cases where the template used in the standard
pipeline did not have enough S/N. We also show the behaviour of the three
activity indicators for the active star YZ CMi and estimate the absolute RV of
the M dwarfs analysed using the CCF RVs.

high-frequency long baseline campaign was organized to test image capabilities
with baselines up to 16 km at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths. We
investigated image qualities using ALMA receiver Bands 7, 8, 9, and 10 (285-875
GHz) by adopting band-to-band (B2B) phase referencing in which a phase
calibrator is tracked at a lower frequency. For B2B phase referencing, it is
expected that a closer phase calibrator to a target can be used, comparing to
standard in-band phase referencing. In the first step, it is ensured that an
instrumental phase offset difference between low- and high-frequency Bands can
be removed using a differential gain calibration in which a phase calibrator is
certainly detected while frequency switching. In the next step, comparative
experiments are arranged to investigate the image quality between B2B and
in-band phase referencing with phase calibrators at various separation angles.
In the final step, we conducted long baseline imaging tests for a quasar at 289
GHz in Band 7 and 405 GHz in Band 8 and complex structure sources of HL Tau and
VY CMa at ~670 GHz in Band 9. The B2B phase referencing was successfully
applied, allowing us to achieve an angular resolution of 14x11 and 10x8 mas for
HL Tau and VY CMa, respectively. There is a high probability of finding a

complex plane consisting of all the roots of the characteristic equation when
the system matrices are subjected to all possible perturbations with a given
upper bound. The pseudospectral abscissa is defined as the maximum real part of
the characteristic roots in the pseudospectrum and, therefore, it is for
instance important from a robust stability point of view. In this paper we
present an accurate method for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa
of retarded delay differential equations with discrete pointwise delays. Our
approach is based on the connections between the pseudospectrum and the level
sets of an appropriately defined complex function. The computation is done in
two steps. In the prediction step, an approximation of the pseudospectral
abscissa is obtained based on a rational approximation of the characteristic
matrix and the application of a bisection algorithm. Each step in this
bisection algorithm relies on checking the presence of the imaginary axis
eigenvalues of a complex matrix, similar to the delay free case. In the
corrector step, the approximate pseudospectral abscissa is corrected to any

flows onto magnetized neutron stars (NSs), of which the magnetic axis is
misaligned with the rotation axis, based on the simulation results by Kawashima
et al.(2016, PASJ, 68, 83). Here, we solve the geodesic equation for light in
the Schwarzschild spacetime in order to take into account the light bending
effect. The gravitational redshift and the relativistic doppler effect from gas
motions of the accretion columns are also incorporated. The pulsed emission
appears since the observed luminosity, which exceeds the Eddington luminosity
for the stellar-mass black holes, periodically changes via precession of the
column caused by the rotation of the NS. The PF tends to increase as
$\theta_{\rm obs}$ approaching to $\theta_{\rm B}$, where $\theta_{\rm obs}$
and $\theta_{\rm B}$ are the observer's viewing angle and the polar angle of
the magnetic axis measured from the rotation axis. The maximum PF is around 50
%. Also, we find that the PF becomes less than 5 % for $\theta_{\rm obs}
\lesssim 5^\circ$ or for $\theta_{\rm B} \lesssim 5^\circ$. Our results are
consistent with observations of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars (ULXPs) with few

neutron star. Although it belongs to the subclass of the bright Atoll sources
together with GX 9+1, GX 3+1, and GX 13+1, its broadband spectrum is poorly
studied and apparently does not show reflection features in the spectrum.
  To constrain the continuum well and verify whether a relativistic smeared
reflection component is present, we analyze the broadband spectrum of GX 9+9
using {\it BeppoSAX} and \textit{XMM-Newton} spectra covering the 0.3-40 keV
energy band.
  We fit the spectrum adopting a model composed of a disk-blackbody plus a
Comptonized component whose seed photons have a blackbody spectrum (Eastern
Model). A statistically equivalent model is composed of a Comptonized component
whose seed photons have a disk-blackbody distribution plus a blackbody that
mimics a saturated Comptonization likely associated with a boundary layer
(Western model). Other trials did not return a good fit.
  The spectrum of GX 9+9 was observed in a soft state and its luminosity is
$2.3 \times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ assuming a distance to the source of 5 kpc.
In the Eastern Model scenario, we find the seed-photon temperature and electron
temperature of the Comptonized component to be $1.14^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ keV and
$2.80^{+0.09}_{-0.04}$ keV, respectively, while the optical depth of the
Comptonizing corona is $8.9\pm0.4$. The color temperature of the inner

additional authentication factors if a certain risk level is detected. RBA is
recommended by the NIST digital identity guidelines, is used by several large

there is little scientific research about RBA, slowing down progress and deeper
understanding, making it harder for end users to understand the security

  Characterization of the noise structure, impact on the inferred transit
  parameters, and predictions for CHEOPS observations","  In photometry, the short-timescale stellar variability (""flicker""), such as
that caused by granulation and oscillations, can reach amplitudes comparable to
the transit depth of Earth-sized planets and is correlated over the typical
transit timescales. It can introduce systematic errors on the inferred
planetary parameters when a small number of transits are observed. The
objective of this paper is to characterize the statistical properties of this
noise and quantify its impact on the inferred transit parameters. We used the
extensive solar observations obtained with SoHO/VIRGO to characterize flicker
noise. We simulated realistic transits across the solar disk using SDO/HMI data
and used these to obtain transit light curves, which we used to estimate the
errors made on the transit parameters. We make these light curves publicly
available. To extend the study to a wider parameter range, we derived the
properties of flicker noise using Kepler observations and studied their
dependence on stellar parameters. Finally, we predicted the limiting stellar
apparent magnitude for which the properties of the flicker noise can be
extracted using high-precision CHEOPS and PLATO observations. Stellar
granulation is a stochastic colored noise, and is stationary with respect to
the stellar magnetic cycle. Both the flicker correlation timescales and
amplitudes increase with the stellar mass and radius. If these correlations are
not taken into account when fitting for the parameters of transiting
exoplanets, this can bias the inferred parameters. In particular, we find
errors of up to 10$\%$ on $R_p/R_s$ for an Earth-sized planet orbiting a
Sun-like star. For F and G stars, flicker will significantly affect the
inferred parameters of transits observed with CHEOPS and PLATO. Dedicated
modeling strategies need to be developed to accurately characterize both the
star and the transiting exoplanets.

  effect","  Background: A newly identified dripline nucleus $^{31}$F offers a unique
opportunity to study the two-neutron ($2n$) correlation at the east shore of
the island of inversion where the $N = 28$ shell closure is lost.
  Purpose: We aim to present the first three-body theoretical results for the
radius and total reaction cross sections of $^{31}$F. This will further help to
investigate how the pairing and breakdown of the $N = 28$ shell closure
influence the formation of the $2n$-halo structure and the anti-halo effect in
this mass region.
  Methods: A $^{29}$F$+n+n$ three-body system is described by the cluster
orbital shell model, and its total reaction cross section is calculated by the
Glauber theory.
  Results: Our three-body calculations predict 3.48-3.70 fm for the
root-mean-square radius of $^{31}$F, which corresponds to the total reaction
cross section of 1530 (1410)-1640 (1500) mb for a carbon target at 240 (900)

discussed.
  Conclusions: The present study suggests a novel anti-halo effect in this mass
region: When the pairing overcome the energy gap between the $p_{3/2}$ and
$f_{7/2}$ orbits, the inversion of the occupation number of these orbits takes
place, and it diminishes the $2n$-halo structure.

  contributions to the heating of the local corona","  The knots in solar prominences are often observed to fall with nearly
constant velocity, but the associated physical mechanism is currently not well
understood. In this letter, we presented a prominence observed by New Vacuum
Solar Telescope (NVST) in H-alpha wavelength. Knots that rose within the
prominence appear to have been preferentially located at higher altitude,
whereas those that fell were found throughout the entire prominence structure.
The descending speed of the knots near the solar surface was higher than that
far away from the solar surface. We noted that the knots near the solar surface
may run along a set of coronal loops observed from the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly. Elsewhere, the majority of knots are interpreted to have descended
across more horizontal magnetic field with a nearly constant speed. This lack
of acceleration indicates that the liberated gravitational potential energy may
not manifest as an increase in kinetic energy. Assuming instead that the
descending knots were capable of exciting Alfven waves that could then
dissipate within the local corona, the gravitational potential energy of the
knots may have been converted into thermal energy. Assuming a perfectly elastic
system, we therefore estimate that the gravitational energy loss rate of these
observed knots amounts to 1/2000 of that required to heat the entire quiet-Sun,
increasing to 1/320 when considering possibly further downward motions of the
knots having disappeared in the H-alpha observations. This result suggests such
a mechanism may contribute to the heating of the corona local to these
prominences.

electrode design and age, as well as water saturation, pore water chemistry,
clay content, and temperature in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. We
present a unique long-term SP monitoring experiment focusing on the first four
years of data acquired at different depths in the vadose zone within the HOBE

with flow and transport simulations, we attempt to replicate the observed data

satisfactory during the first six months of monitoring after which both the

observations are (1) that predicted SP magnitudes are strongly sensitive to how
the effective excess charge scales with water saturation implying that
continued research is needed to build more accurate models of electrokinetic
phenomena in unsaturated conditions, (2) that significant changes in electrode
polarization occur in the shallowest electrodes at time scales of a year,
suggesting that electrode effects cannot be ignored and that explicit electrode
modeling should be considered in future monitoring studies, and (3) that
multi-rate mass transfer and reactive transport modeling are needed to better
predict salinity and pore water conductivity. We hope to stimulate other
researchers to test new SP modeling approaches and interpretation strategies
against these data by making the SP and complimentary data time-series

tunability of optical and electrical properties in semiconducting or metallic

and requires sophisticated surface or dimensionality manipulation. In this

formation of {111} surface facets, which shows metallic and superconducting
properties in contrast to other forms of this semiconducting crystal, which
contain other surface facets ({100} and {110}). This effect, which has been

2003.08279v1,2020-03-18,2020-03-18,Shortcuts to Adiabatic Pumping in Classical Stochastic Systems,"  Adiabatic pumping is characterized by a geometric contribution to the pumped
charge, which can be non-zero even in the absence of a bias. However, as the
driving speed is increased, non-adiabatic excitations gradually reduce the
pumped charge, thereby limiting the maximal applicable driving frequencies. To
circumvent this problem, we here extend the concept of shortcuts to
adiabaticity to construct a control protocol which enables geometric pumping
well beyond the adiabatic regime. Our protocol allows for an increase, by more
than an order of magnitude, in the driving frequencies, and the method is also
robust against moderate fluctuations of the control field. We provide a
geometric interpretation of the control protocol and analyze the thermodynamic
cost of implementing it. Our findings can be realized using current technology
and potentially enable fast pumping of charge or heat in quantum dots, as well
as in other stochastic systems from physics, chemistry, and biology.

present work addresses the evaluation of code improvements along with the
computational performance of the solver running on a computer with maximum
theoretical peak of 2.727 PFlops. Different mesh configurations, whose size
varies from a few hundred thousand to approximately one billion grid points,

Mott insulators, predicted to realize the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL).
This exactly solvable model involves a highly entangled state resulting from
bond-dependent Ising interactions that produce excitations which are non-local
in terms of spin flips. A key challenge in real materials is identifying the
relative size of the non-Kitaev terms and their role in the emergence or
suppression of fractional excitations. Here, we identify the energy and
temperature boundaries of non-Kitaev interactions by direct comparison of the
Raman susceptibility of RuCl3 with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results for the
Kitaev QSLs. Moreover, we further confirm the fractional nature of the magnetic
excitations, which is given by creating a pair of fermionic quasiparticles.
Interestingly, this fermionic response remains valid in the non-Kitaev range.
Our results and focus on the use of the Raman susceptibility provide a
stringent new test for future theoretical and experimental studies of QSLs.

based on three subjective experiments on a novel image dataset that objects in

Our dataset, named SalMoN (saliency in multi-object natural images), has 588
images containing multiple objects. The subjective experiments performed record
spontaneous attention and perception through eye fixation duration, point

from the salient object class detection capability. For this purpose, we
generate multi-level maps as ground truth corresponding to all the dataset

multi-level salient objects and background. We then propose the use of mean
absolute error, Kendall's rank correlation and average area under
precision-recall curve to evaluate existing salient object detection methods on
our multi-level saliency ground truth dataset. Approaches that represent
saliency detection on images as local-global hierarchical processing of a graph

  the CDF-S","  Obscured AGN represent a significant fraction of the entire AGN population,
especially at high redshift (~70% at z=3--5). They are often characterized by
the presence of large gas and dust reservoirs that are thought to sustain and
possibly obscure vigorous star formation processes that make these objects
shine at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths. We exploit ALMA Cycle 4 observations of
the continuum (~2.1mm) and high-J CO emission of a sample of six X-ray selected
SMGs hosting an obscured AGN at z_spec>2.5 in the 7 Ms CDF-S. We measured the
masses and sizes of the dust and molecular gas and we derived the gas density
and column density on the basis of a uniform sphere geometry. Finally, we
compared the measured column densities with those derived from the Chandra
X-ray spectra. We detected both the continuum and line emission for three
sources for which we measured both the flux density and size. For the
undetected sources, we derived an upper limit on the flux density. We found
that the detected galaxies are rich in gas and dust (molecular gas mass in the
range <0.5 - 2.7 x 10^10 M_sun for {\alpha}_CO=0.8 and up to ~2 x 10^11~M_sun
for {\alpha}_CO=6.5, and dust mass <0.9 - 4.9 x 10^8 M_sun) and compact (gas
major axis 2.1-3.0 kpc, dust major axis 1.4-2.7 kpc). The column densities
associated with the ISM are on the order of 10^(23-24) cm-2, which is
comparable with those derived from the X-ray spectra. For the detected sources
we also derived dynamical masses in the range 0.8 - 3.7 x 10^10 M_sun. We
conclude that the ISM of high redshift galaxies can substantially contribute to
nuclear obscuration up to the Compton-thick (>10^24 cm-2) regime. In addition,
we found that all the detected sources show a velocity gradient reminding one
rotating system, even though two of them show peculiar features in their
morphology that can be associated with a chaotic, possibly merging, structure.

to AGN feedback. Specifically, COS provides high-quality far-ultraviolet (FUV)
spectra covering the diagnostic-rich 500-1050 Angstrom rest frame (hereafter,

distance of most outflows from the central source ($R$). The first objective is
impossible to achieve with ground-based spectra, and $R$ can be measured in

  1) Measurements of the three most energetic outflows to date, which can be
the main agents for AGN feedback processes in the environments of the host
galaxies.
  2) All the outflows have a very high-ionization component, similar to the one
found in warm absorbers, which carries most of the outflow's kinetic
luminosity. This finding suggests that all the high-ionization outflows

$\lambda$ 629.73 and the Mg X $\lambda\lambda$ 609.79, 624.94 doublet. This is
the first time where a quasar outflow velocity shift is observed in troughs
from more than one ion and in distinct troughs from a doublet transition (Ne
VIII). We attribute the velocity shift to an acceleration of an existing
outflow as we are able to exclude photoionization changes and motion of
material into and out of the line of sight as alternate explanations. This
leads to an average acceleration of 480 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ (1.52 cm
s$^{-2}$) in the quasar rest frame. Both the acceleration and the absolute
velocity shift are the largest reported for a quasar outflow to date. Based on
the absorption troughs of the O V* multiplet, we derive a range for the
distance of the outflow ($R$) from the central source, 0.05 pc $<$ $R$ $<$ 54.3
pc. This outflow shows similarities with the fast X-ray outflow detected in
quasar PG 1211+143. We use the acceleration and velocity shift to constrain
radiatively accelerated active galactic nucleus disk-wind models and use them
to make predictions for future observations.

where the column density of the very high-ionization phase is roughly 15 times
larger than the corresponding high-ionization phase. These high column
densities and very high-ionization potential ions are similar to X-ray warm
absorbers. The two phases of S2 show a unique velocity centroid shift between

troughs, we determine the electron number density of S2 (fully corroborated by

both high-ionization species, including N III, O III, and S IV, and very
high-ionization species, including Ar VIII, Ne VIII, and Na IX. The derived
photoionization solutions show that each outflow requires a two
ionization-phase solution. For S1, troughs from S IV* and S IV allow us to
derive an electron number density, $n_{e}$ = 1.8$\times$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, and
its distance from the central source of $R$ = 270 pc. For S2, troughs from O

fluid in a chemically heterogeneous capillary slit made from two parallel
adjacent walls each patterned with a single stripe. Using a mesoscopic modified
Kelvin equation, which determines the shape of the menisci pinned at the stripe
edges in the bridge phase, we determine the conditions under which the local
bridging transition precedes capillary condensation as the pressure (or
chemical potential) is increased. Provided the contact angle of the stripe is
less than that of the outer wall we show that triple points, where evaporated,
locally condensed and globally condensed states all coexist are possible
depending on the value of the aspect ratio $a=L/H$ where $H$ is the stripe
width and $L$ the wall separation. In particular, for a capillary made from
completely dry walls patterned with completely wet stripes the condition for
the triple point occurs when the aspect ratio takes its maximum possible value
$8/\pi$. These predictions are tested using a fully microscopic classical
Density Functional Theory and shown to be remarkably accurate even for
molecularly narrow slits. The qualitative differences with local and global
condensation in heterogeneous cylindrical pores are also highlighted.

magnetoresistivity measurements. In agreement with previous experiments we
confirm that superconductivity disappears near a critical pressure $p_{\rm c}
\approx 1.5$~GPa, and a magnetically ordered state appears. The unusual $H_{\rm
c2}(T)$ at low temperatures for $H \parallel a$ suggests that the multiple
superconducting phases which appear under pressure have quite different $H_{\rm
c2}$. For a field applied along the hard magnetization $b$ axis $H_{\rm c2}
(0)$ is glued to the metamagnetic transition $H_{\rm m}$ which is suppressed
near $p_{\rm c}$. The suppression of $H_{\rm m}$ with pressure follows the
decrease of temperature $T_{\chi}^{\rm max}$, at the maximum in the
susceptibility along $b$. The strong reinforcement of $H_{\rm c2}$ at ambient
pressure for $H \parallel b$ above 16~T is rapidly suppressed under pressure
due to the increase of $T_{\rm sc}$ and the decrease of $H_{\rm m}$. The change
in the hierarchy of the anisotropy of $H_{\rm c2}(0)$ on approaching $p_{\rm

to estimate the size of the radio core to be $<12\times5~\mu$as and to reveal a

galaxy rotation curves pass through a maximum distance of more than $\sim 1$
kpc from the center with a subsequent decrease in the rotation velocity. The
galaxy position in the Tully-Fisher (TF) and baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF)
diagrams show that the values of maximum rotation velocities are located on the
same sequence with other galaxies, while the velocities at the disk periphery
for some galaxies are significantly lower than the expected values for a given
mass or luminosity. Thus, the decrease in the rotation curve can be associated
with a reduced contribution of the dark halo to the rotation velocity. For
seven galaxies with the longest rotation curves, the disk mass was estimated to
be with the dark halo (Newtonian model) and without the halo (modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) model). In four of the galaxies, the MOND model
encounters difficulties in interpreting the rotation curve: in order to be
consistent with the observations, the MOND parameter $a_0$ should differ
significantly from the expected value $a_0 \sim 10^{-8}$ cm/s$^2$, while the
disk mass exceeds the value based on IR photometry and maximum disk model. The
conflict with MOND is the most significant for NGC 157.

advantage of the DDAE modeling framework is that any interconnection of systems

respect to arbitrarily small delay perturbations. Due to this sensitivity, we
introduce the strong H-infinity norm which explicitly takes into account small
delay perturbations, inevitable in any practical control application. We

Using this algorithm and the computation of the gradient of the strong

Covid-19 in countries where different policies of containment were activated.
It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential,

policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime
following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase
transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed
in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in
crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a
quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment
policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread
but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results
show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking
positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found
values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and
Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment

Perez (2019) (BP19), to interpret solar-wind turbulent power spectra beyond
Taylor approximation (TA). The turbulent power spectra were measured using
\emph{Helios} spacecraft data near 0.6 au. We use the model proposed in BP19 to
reproduce the field-perpendicular power spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ of anti-sunward
Alfv\'enic fluctuations in the plasma frame (where $k_\perp$ is the
field-perpendicular wavenumber) from the corresponding measured frequency power
spectrum $P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ along the sampling angle $\theta_b$,
which is the angle between the local magnetic field and the sampling direction.
Here $\omega=2\pi f$ and $f$ is the frequency of the time signal. Interestingly
enough, we found that for all corresponding measured frequency power spectrum
$P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ the reproduced field-perpendicular power spectrum
$E(k_\perp)$ is the same and independent of the considered sampling angle
$\theta_b$. This finding is consistent with the fact that the analyzed
turbulence is strong and highly anisotropic with $k_\| \ll k_\perp$ (where
$k_\|$ is the field-parallel wavenumber). Furthermore, for this specific time
signal we found that the commonly used TA is still approximately valid with the
important difference that a broadening in $k_\perp$ for each angular frequency
$\omega$ is present. This broadening can be described in the context of the

(e.g., simple polyelectrolytes) serve for a controlled synthesis of the
nanoparticles and prevent coagulation during catalysis. Recently, however,
hybrid conjugates of nanoparticles and synthetic thermosensitive polymers have
been developed that enable to change the catalytic activity of the
nanoparticles by external triggers. In particular, nanoparticles embedded in a
stimuli-responsive network made from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) have
become the most-studied examples of such hybrids. It has been demonstrated that
the permeability of the polymer network and thus the reactant flux can be
switched and controlled by external stimuli. Such ""active carriers"" may thus be
viewed as true nanoreactors that open up new design routes in nano-catalysis

the virial series, cell models, and computer simulation. All of them were
directed toward understanding the statistical thermodynamics of simple model
systems. Our last joint work is also the most cited, with over 1000 citations,

1968 and published that October. Here I summarize my own most recent work on
compressible time-reversible two-dimensional maps. These simplest of model
systems are amenable to computer simulation and are providing stimulating and
surprising results.

  space","  Aims. Formamide (HCONH2) is the simplest molecule containing the peptide bond
first detected in the gas phase in Orion-KL and SgrB2. In recent years, it has
been observed in high temperature regions such as hot corinos, where thermal
desorption is responsible for the sublimation of frozen mantles into the gas
phase. The interpretation of observations can benefit from information gathered
in the laboratory, where it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption
process and to study formamide under simulated space conditions such as UV
irradiation. Methods. Here, two laboratory analyses are reported: we studied
formamide photo-stability under UV irradiation when it is adsorbed by space
relevant minerals at 63 K and in the vacuum regime. We also investigated
temperature programmed desorption of pure formamide ice in the presence of TiO2
dust before and after UV irradiation. Results. Through these analyses, the
effects of UV degradation and the interaction between formamide and different
minerals are compared.We find that silicates, both hydrates and anhydrates,
offer molecules a higher level of protection from UV degradation than mineral
oxides. The desorption temperature found for pure formamide is 220 K. The
desorption temperature increases to 250 K when the formamide desorbs from the
surface of TiO2 grains. Conclusions. Through the experiments outlined here, it
is possible to follow the desorption of formamide and its fragments, simulate
the desorption process in star forming regions and hot corinos, and constrain
parameters such as the thermal desorption temperature of formamide and its
fragments and the binding energies involved. Our results offer support to
observational data and improve our understanding of the role of the grain
surface in enriching the chemistry in space.

combination with creating low-energy GBs by modifying the processing
conditions, so-called GB engineering, is of great importance for controlling
and reducing the defect density, leading to improved functionalities of
polycrystalline metals and ceramics. For superconductors particularly,
including both low- and high-temperature superconductors, GB engineering has
been developed to improve especially the critical current densities, Jc, across
these GBs. The intrinsic physical properties of a given superconductor such as
the coherence length, the order parameter symmetry, and their anisotropies
would determine the strategy of GB engineering. In this topical review, we
present an overview of the GB characteristics and GB engineering of Fe-based
superconductors (FBS) in the form of polycrystalline bulks and wires, and thin
films with application potential, e.g. for high-field magnet wires. Prior to
the FBS, GB engineering of the cuprates and MgB2 are also briefly covered.

  orbiter of the Earth-Moon system","  Any near-Earth object (NEO) following an Earth-like orbit may eventually be
captured by Earth's gravity during low-velocity encounters. This theoretical
possibility was first attested during the fly-by of 1991 VG in 1991-1992 with
the confirmation of a brief capture episode ---for about a month in 1992
February. Further evidence was obtained when 2006 RH120 was temporarily
captured into a geocentric orbit from 2006 July to 2007 July. Here, we perform
a numerical assessment of the orbital evolution of 2020 CD3, a small NEO found
recently that could be the third instance of a meteoroid temporarily captured
by Earth's gravity. We confirm that 2020 CD3 is currently following a
geocentric trajectory although it will escape into a heliocentric path by early
May 2020. Our calculations indicate that it was captured by the Earth in 2016
(median). This episode is longer than that of 2006 RH120. Prior to its capture
as a minimoon, 2020 CD3 was probably a NEO of the Aten type, but an Apollo type
cannot be excluded; in both cases, the orbit was very Earth-like, with low
eccentricity and low inclination, typical of an Arjuna-type meteoroid. A few
clone orbits remained geocentric for nearly a century, opening the door to the
existence of yet-to-be-detected minimoons that are relatively stable for
time-scales comparable to those of unbound quasi-satellites such as (469219)

  cooling in accreting systems","  Valuable information about the neutron star interior can be obtained by
comparing observations of thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star crust
with theoretical models. Nuclear burning of lighter elements that diffuse to
deeper layers of the envelope can alter the relation between surface and
interior temperatures and can change the chemical composition over time. We
calculate new temperature relations and consider two effects of diffusive
nuclear burning (DNB) for H-C envelopes. First, we consider the effect of a
changing envelope composition and find that hydrogen is consumed on short
timescales and our temperature evolution simulations correspond to those of a
hydrogen-poor envelope within ~100 days. The transition from a hydrogen-rich to
a hydrogen-poor envelope is potentially observable in accreting NS systems as
an additional initial decline in surface temperature at early times after the
outburst. Second, we find that DNB can produce a non-negligible heat flux, such
that the total luminosity can be dominated by DNB in the envelope rather than
heat from the deep interior. However, without continual accretion, heating by
DNB in H-C envelopes is only relevant for <1-80 days after the end of an
accretion outburst, as the amount of light elements is rapidly depleted.
Comparison to crust cooling data shows that DNB does not remove the need for an
additional shallow heating source. We conclude that solving the time-dependent
equations of the burning region in the envelope self-consistently in thermal
evolution models instead of using static temperature relations would be
valuable in future cooling studies.

reported on Mn substituted ferrimagnetic inverse spinel
Ti$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Co$_2$O$_4$ in the temperature interval 1.6 K $\leq$ $T$
$\leq$ 300 K. Our neutron diffraction study reveals cooperative distortions of
the $T$O$_6$ octahedral for all the Jahn-Teller active ions $T$ = Mn$^{3+}$,
Ti$^{3+}$ and Co$^{3+}$, which are confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. Two specific compositions ($x$ = 0.2 and 0.4) have been chosen
because of their unique features: noncollinear Yafet-Kittel type ordering, and
weak tetragonal distortion with ${c/a}$ $<$ 1, in which the apical bond length
$d_c$($T_B$-O) is longer than the equatorial $d_{ab}$($T_B$-O) due to the
splitting of the $e_g$ level of Mn$^{3+}$ ions into $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and
$d_{z^2}$. For $x$ = 0.4, the distortion in the $T_B$O$_6$ octahedra is
stronger as compared to $x$ = 0.2 because of the higher content of trivalent
Mn. Ferrimagnetic ordering in $x$ = 0.4 and $x$ = 0.2 sets in at 110.3 and 78.2
K, respectively due to the unequal magnetic moments of cations, where
Ti$^{3+}$, Mn$^{3+}$, and Co$^{3+}$ occupying the octahedral, whereas,
Co$^{2+}$ sits in the tetrahedral site. In addition, weak antiferromagnetic
component could be observed lying perpendicular to the ferrimagnetic component.
The analysis of static and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities combined with the
heat-capacity data reveals a magnetic compensation phenomenon at $T_{COMP}$ =
25.4 K in $x$ = 0.2 and a reentrant spin-glass behaviour in $x$ = 0.4 with a
freezing temperature $\sim$110.1 K. The compensation phenomenon is
characterized by sign reversal of magnetization and bipolar exchange bias
effect below $T_{COMP}$ with its magnitude depending on the direction of
external magnetic field and the cooling protocol.

different regions, viz., (A) Interior core region, (B) Intermediate thin shell,
and (C) Exterior spherical region. It is assumed that in the interior region
the fluid pressure is equal to a negative matter-energy density providing a
constant repulsive force over the spherical thin shell. This shell at the
intermediate region is assumed to be formed by a fluid of ultrarelativistic
plasma and the pressure, which is directly proportional to the matter-energy
density according to Zeldovich's conjecture of stiff fluid~[Zeldovich, Mon.
Not. R. Astron. Soc. 160 (1972) 1], does nullify the repulsive force exerted by
the interior core region for a stable configuration. On the other hand, the
exterior spherical region can be described by the exterior Schwarzschild-de
Sitter solution. With all these specifications we have found out a set of exact
and singularity-free solutions of the gravastar which presents several
physically interesting as well as valid features within the framework of

  groups","  Galaxy groups provide the means for a great diversity of studies that
contribute to a better understanding of the structure of the universe on a
large scale and allow the properties of galaxies to be linked to those of the
host halos. However, the identification of galaxy systems is a challenging task
and therefore it is necessary to improve the techniques involved as much as
possible. In view of the large present and forthcoming galaxy catalogues, we
propose, implement, and evaluate an algorithm that combines the two most
popular techniques used to identify galaxy systems. The algorithm can be easily
applied to any spectroscopic galaxy catalogue, but here we demonstrate its use
on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Assuming that a galaxy group is a
gravitationally bounded system that has at least one bright galaxy, we begin by
identifying groups with a Friends-Of-Friends algorithm adapted to fit this
definition. In view of the shortcomings of this method, particularly the lack
of ability to identify low-number groups, and consequently the inability to
study the occupation of halos throughout the mass range, we improve it by
adding a halo-based procedure. To assess the performance, we construct a mock
catalogue from a semi-analytical model to compare the groups identified using
our method with those obtained from the simulation. The comparison of groups
extracted using our method with those of a mock catalogue shows that the
proposed algorithm provides excellent results. The modifications introduced to
the Friends-Of-Friends algorithm in the first part of the procedure to fit the
adopted group definition gave reliable groups. Furthermore, the incorporation
of the halo-based method reduces the interlopers while more accurately
reproducing the number of galaxies per group. As a specific application, we use
the algorithm to extract groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

and hydrogels in aqueous solutions is of key importance for the development of
soft functional materials. Here we investigate the partitioning of simple
monoatomic (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Cs$^+$, Cl$^-$, I$^-$) and one molecular ion
(4-nitrophenolate; NP$^-$) within a dense, electroneutral
poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) membrane using explicit-water molecular dynamics
simulations. Inside the predominantly hydrophobic environment water distributes
in a network of polydisperse water nanoclusters. The average cluster size
determines the mean electrostatic self-energy of the simple ions, which
preferably reside deeply inside them; we therefore find substantially larger
partition ratios $K\simeq\>$10$^{-1}$ than expected from a simple Born picture
using a uniform dielectric constant. Despite their irregular shapes we observe
that the water clusters possess a universal negative electrostatic potential
with respect to their surrounding, as is known for aqueous liquid-vapor
interfaces. This potential, which we find concealed in cases of symmetric
monoatomic salts, can dramatically impact the transfer free energies of larger
charged molecules because of their weak hydration and increased affinity to
interfaces. Consequently, and in stark contrast to the simple ions, the
molecular ion NP$^-$ can have a partition ratio much larger than unity,
$K\simeq\>$10-30 (depending on the cation type) or even $10^3$ in excess of
monovalent salt, which explains recent observations of enhanced reaction
kinetics of NP$^-$ reduction catalyzed within dense polymer networks. These
results also suggest that ionizing a molecule can even enhance the partitioning
in a collapsed, rather hydrophobic gel, which strongly challenges the
traditional simplistic reasoning.

and dynamics of a physical system. By fixing the initial state of the system
into the ground state of the Hamiltonian at zero temperature and tuning a
control parameter, we consider the occurrence of the ergodicity with quench
dynamics in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse magnetic
field. The ground-state phase diagram consists of two ferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases. It is known the magnetization in this spin system is
non-ergodic. We set up two different experiments as we call them single and
double quenches and test the dynamics of the magnetization along the $Z$-axis
and the spin-spin correlation function along the $X$-axis which are the order
parameters of the zero-temperature phases . Our exact results reveal that for
single quenches at zero-temperature, the ergodicity depends on the initial
state and the order parameter. Interestingly on the other setup, a double
quench on a cyclic path, ergodicity is completely broken for starting from the
phase corresponding to the order parameter. Otherwise, it depends on the first
quenched point, and the quench time $T$ when the model spent before a second
quench in the way back which gives an ability to controlling the ergodicity in
the system. Therefore, and contrary to expectations, in the mentioned model the
ergodicity can be observed with probing quench dynamics at zero-temperature.
Our results provide further insight into the zero-temperature dynamical
behavior of quantum systems and their connections to the ergodicity phenomenon.

which confirms the source as a member of the cluster. An extinction map
covering a large area (diameter $\sim$ 50') is generated with $H$ and $K$
photometry toward the region. From the map, three distinct locations of peak
extinction complexes ($A_{V}$ $\simeq$ 7$-$17 mag) are identified for the very

$f(R,T,R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity. For this purpose, we have considered
irrotational static cylindrical spacetime coupled with a locally anisotropic
relativistic fluid. After formulating gravitational field and conservation
equations, we have performed orthogonal splitting of the Riemann curvature
tensor. Unlike GR (for spherical case) the one of the structure scalars
$X_{TF}$, has been identified to be a complexity factor. This factor contains
effective forms of the energy density, and anisotropic pressure components. Few
peculiar relations among complexity factor, Tolman mass and Weyl scalar are
also analyzed with the modified $f(R,T,R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ corrections.

  management scheme for reliable high-performance many-core 3D-NoC systems","  The Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm has been proposed as a favorable solution
to handle the strict communication requirements between the increasingly large
number of cores on a single chip. However, NoC systems are exposed to the
aggressive scaling down of transistors, low operating voltages, and high
integration and power densities, making them vulnerable to permanent (hard)
faults and transient (soft) errors. A hard fault in a NoC can lead to external
blocking, causing congestion across the whole network. A soft error is more
challenging because of its silent data corruption, which leads to a large area
of erroneous data due to error propagation, packet re-transmission, and
deadlock. In this paper, we present the architecture and design of a
comprehensive soft error and hard fault-tolerant 3D-NoC system, named
3D-Hard-Fault-Soft-Error-Tolerant-OASIS-NoC (3D-FETO). With the aid of
efficient mechanisms and algorithms, 3D-FETO is capable of detecting and
recovering from soft errors which occur in the routing pipeline stages and
leverages reconfigurable components to handle permanent faults in links, input
buffers, and crossbars. In-depth evaluation results show that the 3D-FETO
system is able to work around different kinds of hard faults and soft errors,
ensuring graceful performance degradation, while minimizing additional hardware
complexity and remaining power efficient.

robotics and computer vision. In that context, localization by learning
matchable image features is gaining popularity due to recent advances in
machine learning. Features that uniquely describe the visual contents of images
have a wide range of applications, including image retrieval and understanding.
In this work, we propose a method that learns image features targeted for
image-retrieval-based localization. Retrieval-based localization has several
benefits, such as easy maintenance and quick computation. However, the
state-of-the-art features only provide visual similarity scores which do not
explicitly reveal the geometric distance between query and retrieved images.
Knowing this distance is highly desirable for accurate localization, especially
when the reference images are sparsely distributed in the scene. Therefore, we
propose a novel loss function for learning image features which are both
visually representative and geometrically relatable. This is achieved by
guiding the learning process such that the feature and geometric distances
between images are directly proportional. In our experiments we show that our
features not only offer significantly better localization accuracy, but also
allow to estimate the trajectory of a query sequence in absence of the
reference images.

recognition datasets. Furthermore, since the last layer of the CNN has
class-specific information, we apply an attention mechanism on the output
feature maps of the CNN to extract more discriminative and powerful features

abundance to be reproduced with the growth of originally iron-depleted embryos

maximum increase in the mass of the Earth embryo due to the accumulation of
planetesimals in a gas-free medium is then threefold, and the current
terrestrial iron abundance is not attained. If the embryos are assumed to have

recently. Existing works are limited to either merely predicting the node
attributes of graphs with fixed topology or predicting only the graph topology
without considering node attributes, but cannot simultaneously predict both of
them, due to substantial challenges: 1) difficulty in characterizing the
interactive, iterative, and asynchronous translation process of both nodes and
edges and 2) difficulty in discovering and maintaining the inherent consistency
between the node and edge in predicted graphs. These challenges prevent a
generic, end-to-end framework for joint node and edge attributes prediction,
which is a need for real-world applications such as malware confinement in IoT

applications highly depend on hand-crafting and ad-hoc heuristic models, but
cannot sufficiently utilize massive historical data. In this paper, we termed
this generic problem ""multi-attributed graph translation"" and developed a novel

considerable portion of the water could have been delivered to the Earth's
embryo, when its mass was smaller than the current mass of the Earth. While the
Earth's embryo mass was growing to half the current mass of the Earth, the mass
of water delivered to the embryo could be near 30% of the total amount of water
delivered to the Earth from the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn. Water of
the terrestrial oceans could be a result of mixing the water from several
sources with higher and lower D/H ratios. The mass of water delivered to Venus
from beyond Jupiter's orbit was almost the same as that for the Earth, if
normalized to unit mass of the planet. The analogous per-unit mass of water
delivered to Mars was two-three times as much as that for the Earth. The mass
of water delivered to the Moon from beyond Jupiter's orbit could be less than
that for the Earth by a factor not more than 20.

  electron gas on liquid helium","  The paper reviews a novel class of phenomena observed recently in the
two-dimensional (2D) electron system formed on the free surface of liquid
helium in the presence of a magnetic field directed normally and exposed to
microwave radiation. The distinctive feature of these nonequilibrium phenomena
is magnetoconductivity oscillations induced by inter-subband (out-of-plane) and
intra-subband (in-plane) microwave excitations. The conductivity
magneto-oscillations induced by intra-subband excitation are similar to
remarkable microwave-induced resistance oscillations (MIRO) reported for
semiconductor heterostructures. Investigations of microwave-induced
conductivity oscillations (MICO) on liquid helium helped with understanding of
the origin of MIRO. Much stronger microwave-induced conductivity oscillations
were observed and well described theoretically for resonant inter-subband
microwave excitation. At strong powers, such excitation leads to
zero-resistance states (ZRS), the in-plane redistribution of electrons,
self-generated audio-frequency oscillations, and incompressible states. These
phenomena are caused by unusual current states of the 2D electron system formed
under resonant microwave excitation.

prior work relying on supervision from, e.g., 3D ground-truth, multiple images

to solve this problem with four components: (i) an encoder that infers the
latent 3D representation from an image, (ii) a decoder that generates an
explicit 2.5D surfel-based reconstruction of a scene from the latent code (iii)
a differentiable renderer that synthesizes a 2D image from the surfel
representation, and (iv) a critic network trained to discriminate between
images generated by the decoder-renderer and those from a training
distribution. Pix2Shape can generate complex 3D scenes that scale with the
view-dependent on-screen resolution, unlike representations that capture
world-space resolution, i.e., voxels or meshes. We show that Pix2Shape learns a
consistent scene representation in its encoded latent space and that the
decoder can then be applied to this latent representation in order to
synthesize the scene from a novel viewpoint. We evaluate Pix2Shape with
experiments on the ShapeNet dataset as well as on a novel benchmark we
developed, called 3D-IQTT, to evaluate models based on their ability to enable
3d spatial reasoning. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrate
Pix2Shape's ability to solve scene reconstruction, generation, and

as elementary excitations of the spinor field, the generalized operator of the
spin-orbit interaction is obtained using non-relativistic approximation in the
Hamilton operator of the spinor field taking into account the presence of an
external potential. This operator is shown to contain a new term in addition to
the known ones. By an example of a model potential in the form of a quantum
well, it is demonstrated that the Schroedinger equation with the generalized
spin-orbit interaction operator describes all spin states obtained directly
from the Dirac equation. The dependence of the spin-orbit interaction on the
spin states in quasi-two-dimensional systems of electrons localized in a
quantum well is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the electric current in the
quantum well layer induces the spin polarization of charge carriers near the
boundary surfaces of the layer, with the polarization of the charge carriers
being opposite at the different surfaces. This phenomenon appears due to the
spin-orbit interaction and is known as the spin Hall effect, which was observed
experimentally in heterostructures with the corresponding geometry.

object and a semi-regular variable, brightened at the beginning of August 2018,
showing signatures of a symbiotic star outburst. We aim to confirm the nature
of V426 Sge as a classical symbiotic star, determine the photometric ephemeris
of the light minima, and suggest the path from its 1968 symbiotic nova outburst
to the following 2018 Z And-type outburst. We re-constructed an historical
light curve (LC) of V426 Sge from approximately the year 1900, and used
original low- and high-resolution spectroscopy complemented with Swift-XRT and
UVOT, optical UBVRcIc and near-infrared JHKL photometry obtained during the
2018 outburst and the following quiescence. The historical LC reveals no
symbiotic-like activity from 1900 to 1967. In 1968, V426 Sge experienced a
symbiotic nova outburst that ceased around 1990. From approximately 1972, a
wave-like orbitally related variation with a period of $493.4\pm 0.7$ days
developed in the LC. This was interrupted by a Z And-type outburst from the
beginning of August 2018 to the middle of February 2019. At the maximum of the
2018 outburst, the burning white dwarf (WD) increased its temperature to
$>2\times 10^5$ K, generated a luminosity of $\sim 7\times 10^{37}(d/3.3kpc)^2$
erg/s, and blew a wind at the rate of $\sim 3\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr.
The donor is a normal M4-5 III giant and the accretor is a low-mass $\sim$0.5
M$_{\odot}$ WD. During the transition from the symbiotic nova outburst to the
quiescent phase, a pronounced sinusoidal variation along the orbit develops in
the LC of most symbiotic novae. The following eventual outburst is of Z
And-type, when the accretion by the WD temporarily exceeds the upper limit of
the stable burning. At this point the system becomes a classical symbiotic
star.

to strong flares and fast halo coronal mass ejections CMEs. In the present
paper, we carefully identify the chain of events from the Sun to the Earth
induced by all 12 X-class flares that occurred in 2002. In this small sample,
we find an unusual high rate (58\%) of solar sources with a longitude larger
than 74 degrees. Yet, all 12 X-class flares are associated with at least one
CME. The fast halo CMEs (50\% ) are related to interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at
L1 and weak Dst minimum values ($> -51\;$nT); while 5 (41\%) of the 12 X-class
flares are related to solar proton events (SPE). We conclude that: (i) All
twelve analyzed solar events, even those associated with fast halo CMEs
originating from the central disk region, and those ICMEs and SPEs were not
very geo-effective. This unexpected result demonstrates that the suggested
events in the chain (fast halo CME, X-class flares, central disk region, ICME,
SPE) are not infallible proxies for geo-effectiveness. (ii) The low value of
integrated and normalized southward component of the IMF ($B^*_z$) may explain
the low geo-effectiveness for this small sample. In fact, $B^*_z$ is well
correlated to the weak Dst and low auroral electrojet (AE) activity. Hence, the
only space weather impact at Earth in 2002 we can explain is based on $B^*_z$

cyber-physical system (CPS), it is difficult to restore the complete attack

attacks on electric power CPS based on temporal-topological correlation. First,
the attack events are aggregated according to the alarm log of the cyber space,
and a temporal-causal Bayesian network-based cyber attack recognition algorithm
is proposed to parse out the cyber attack sequences of the same attacker. Then,
according to the characteristic curves of different attack measurement data in
physical space, a combination of physical attack event criteria algorithm is
designed to distinguish the types of physical attack events. Finally, physical
attack events and cyber attack sequences are matched via temporal-topological
correlation, frequent patterns of attack sequences are extracted, and hidden
multi-step attack patterns are found from scattered grid measurement data and
information from alarm logs. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
method are verified by the testbed at Mississippi State University.

the effect of hole doping upon the Jeff=1/2 Mott-insulating state in Sr2IrO4,
via Rh replacement of the Ir site. The spin-wave gap, associated with XY-type
spin-exchange anisotropy, collapses with increasing Rh content, prior to the
suppression of the Mott-insulating state and in contrast to electron doping via
La substitution of the Sr site. At the same time, despite heavy damping, the
d-d excitation spectra retain their overall amplitude and dispersion character.
A careful study of the spin-wave spectrum reveals that deviations from the
J1-J2-J3 Heisenberg used to model the pristine system disappear at intermediate
doping levels. These findings are interpreted in terms of a modulation of Ir-Ir
correlations due to the influence of Rh impurities upon nearby Ir wave
functions, even as the single-band Jeff=1/2 model remains valid up to full
carrier delocalization. They underline the importance of the transition metal
site symmetry when doping pseudospin systems such as Sr2IrO4.

has at least $r$ infected neighbors. In this paper, we focus on a random graph

the well-studied stochastic blockmodel. When the graph is not exceptionally

$\omega(n^{-(1+1/r)})$, under certain mild assumptions, we prove that the
optimal seeding strategy is to put all the seeds in a single community. This
matches the intuition that in a nonsubmodular cascade model placing seeds near
each other creates synergy. However, it sharply contrasts with the intuition
for submodular cascade models (e.g., the independent cascade model and the
linear threshold model) in which nearby seeds tend to erode each others'
effects. Our key technique is a novel time-asynchronized coupling of four
cascade processes. Finally, we show that this observation yields a polynomial

hadronic) has been a long-standing matter of debate. Here, we focus on one
variant of hadronic models where proton synchrotron radiation accounts for the
observed steady $\gamma$-ray blazar emission. Using analytical methods, we
derive the minimum jet power ($P_{j,\min}$) for the largest blazar sample
analyzed to date (145 sources), taking into account uncertainties of
observables and jet's physical parameters. We compare $P_{j,\min}$ against
three characteristic energy estimators for accreting systems, i.e., the
Eddington luminosity, the accretion disk luminosity, and the power of the
Blandford-Znajek process, and find that $P_{j,\min}$ is about 2 orders of
magnitude higher than all energetic estimators for the majority of our sample.
The derived magnetic field strengths in the emission region require either
large amplification of the jet's magnetic field (factor of 30) or place the
$\gamma$-ray production site at sub-pc scales. The expected neutrino emission
peaks at $\sim 0.1-10$ EeV, with typical peak neutrino fluxes $\sim 10^{-4}$
times lower than the peak $\gamma$-ray fluxes. We conclude that if relativistic
hadrons are present in blazar jets, they can only produce a radiatively
subdominant component of the overall spectral energy distribution of the
blazar's steady emission.

is always correct. Fault attacks break and exploit that assumption. Through the
careful introduction of targeted faults, an adversary modifies the control-flow
or data-flow integrity of software. The modified program execution is then
analyzed and used as a source of information leakage, or as a mechanism for
privilege escalation. Due to the increasing complexity of modern embedded
systems, and due to the difficulty of guaranteeing correct hardware execution
even under a weak adversary, fault attacks are a growing threat. For example,
the assumption that an adversary has to be close to the physical execution of
software, in order to inject an exploitable fault into hardware, has repeatedly
been shown to be incorrect. This article is a review on hardware-based fault
attacks on software, with emphasis on the context of embedded systems. We
present a detailed discussion of the anatomy of a fault attack, and we make a
review of fault attack evaluation techniques. The paper emphasizes the
perspective from the attacker, rather than the perspective of countermeasure
development. However, we emphasize that improvements to countermeasures often
build on insight into the attacks.

2003.11911v1,2020-03-23,2020-03-23,Resilient Distributed Diffusion for Multi-task Estimation,"  Distributed diffusion is a powerful algorithm for multi-task state estimation
which enables networked agents to interact with neighbors to process input data
and diffuse information across the network. Compared to a centralized approach,
diffusion offers multiple advantages that include robustness to node and link
failures. In this paper, we consider distributed diffusion for multi-task
estimation where networked agents must estimate distinct but correlated states
of interest by processing streaming data. By exploiting the adaptive weights
used for diffusing information, we develop attack models that drive normal
agents to converge to states selected by the attacker. The attack models can be
used for both stationary and non-stationary state estimation. In addition, we
develop a resilient distributed diffusion algorithm under the assumption that
the number of compromised nodes in the neighborhood of each normal node is
bounded by $F$ and we show that resilience may be obtained at the cost of
performance degradation. Finally, we evaluate the proposed attack models and
resilient distributed diffusion algorithm using stationary and non-stationary
multi-target localization.

operators for operand intervals bounded by floating-point numbers. Actual
implementations need to make a large case analysis that considers, e.g.,
magnitude relations between all pairs of argument bounds, positional relations
between the arguments and zero, and handling of the special values, infinities
and NaN. Their correctness is not obvious as they are implemented by human
hands, which comes to be critical for the reliability. This work provides a
mechanically-verified interval arithmetic library. For this purpose, we utilize
the Why3 platform equipped with a specification language for annotated programs
and back-end theorem provers. We conduct several proof tasks for each of three
properties of the target code: validity, soundness, and tightness; zero
division exception handling is also verified for the division code. To
accomplish the proof, we propose several techniques for
specification/verification. First, we specify additional lemmas that support
deductions made by back-end SMT solvers, which enable to discharge proof
obligations in floating-point arithmetic containing nonlinear terms. Second, we
examine the annotation of tightness, which requires to assume that a
computation may result in NaN; we propose specific extremum operators for this
purpose. In the experiments, applying the techniques in conjunction with the
Alt-Ergo SMT solver and the Coq proof assistant proved the entire code.

atomic-scale designs has become one of the most effective interface-engineering

buffer layer on amorphous and crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. The
LaFeO3 buffer layer acts as an energetically favored electron acceptor in both
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 systems, resulting in modulation of interfacial carrier density
and hence metal-to-insulator transition. For amorphous and crystalline
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, the metal-to-insulator transition is found when
the LaFeO3 layer thickness crosses 3 and 6 unit cells, respectively. Such
different critical LaFeO3 thicknesses are explained in terms of distinct
characteristic lengths of the redox-reaction-mediated and
polar-catastrophe-dominated charge transfer, controlled by the interfacial
atomic contact and Thomas-Fermi screening effect, respectively. Our results not
only shed light on the complex interlayer charge transfer across oxide
heterostructures but also provides a new route to precisely tailor the
charge-transfer process at a functional interface.

modification of the method of Pad\'e approximants that are known to provide the
best approximation for the class of rational functions, but do not provide
sufficient accuracy or cannot be applied at all for those nonlinear problems,
whose solutions exhibit behaviour characterized by irrational functions. In
order to improve the accuracy, we suggest a method of self-similarly corrected
Pad\'e approximants, taking into account irrational functional behaviour. The
idea of the method is in representing the sought solution as a product of two
factors, one of which is given by a self-similar root approximant, responsible
for irrational functional behaviour, and the other being a Pad\'e approximant
corresponding to a rational function. The efficiency of the method is
illustrated by constructing very accurate solutions for nonlinear differential
equations. A thorough investigation is given proving that the suggested method
is more accurate than the method of standard Pad\'e approximants.

which extracts the generated electron and hole wavefunctions and their emission

interferometry with signal processing. Using our technique, we extract the

electrons. By demonstrating the synthesis and complete characterization of
electronic wavefunctions in conductors, this work offers perspectives for
quantum information processing with electrical currents and for investigating
basic quantum physics in many-body systems.

in orbital distance. Previously, only two such systems have been found. Here,
we report the discovery of a third system using data from the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The host star, TOI-1130, is an 11th
magnitude K-dwarf in the Gaia G band. It has two transiting planets: a
Neptune-sized planet ($3.65\pm 0.10$ $R_E$) with a 4.1-day period, and a hot
Jupiter ($1.50^{+0.27}_{-0.22}$ $R_J$) with an 8.4-day period. Precise
radial-velocity observations show that the mass of the hot Jupiter is
$0.974^{+0.043}_{-0.044}$ $M_J$. For the inner Neptune, the data provide only
an upper limit on the mass of 0.17 $M_J$ (3$\sigma$). Nevertheless, we are
confident the inner planet is real, based on follow-up ground-based photometry
and adaptive optics imaging that rule out other plausible sources of the TESS
transit signal. The unusual planetary architecture of and the brightness of the
host star make TOI-1130 a good test case for planet formation theories, and an
attractive target for future spectroscopic observations.

components of the field under consideration can be generated is written down
explicitly. Later, we focus on the electromagnetic field and employ the classic
Appell's trick (moving the source into a complex space) to get so called
electromagnetic magic field on the Kerr background. Thus the field of
nontrivial extended yet spatially bounded source is obtained. We also show that
a static electric point charge above the Kerr black hole induces, except an
expected electric monopole, also a magnetic monopole charge on the black hole
itself. This contribution has to be compensated. On a general level we discuss
Teukolsky-Starobinsky identities in terms of the Debye potentials.

Goldstone theorem for a quantum field formulation of molecules and solids.
Along with phonons two types of new quasiparticles appear: rotons and
translons. In full analogy with Lorentz covariance, combining space and time
coordinates, a new covariance is necessary, binding together the internal and
external degrees of freedom, without explicitly separating the centre-of-mass,
which normally applies in both classical and quantum formulations. The
generally accepted view regarding the lack of a simple correspondence between
the Goldstone modes and broken symmetries, has significant consequences: an
ambiguous BCS theory as well as a subsequent Higgs mechanism. The application
of the archetype of the classical spontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e. the
Mexican hat, as compared to standard quantum relations, i.e. the Jahn-Teller
effect, superconductivity or the Higgs mechanism, becomes a disparity. In
short, symmetry broken states have a microscopic causal origin, but transitions
between them have a teleological component. The different treatments of the
problem of the centre of gravity in quantum mechanics and in field theories
imply a second type of Bohr complementarity on the many-body level opening the
door for megascopic representations of all basic microscopic quantum axioms
with further readings for teleonomic megascopic quantum phenomena, which have
no microscopic rationale: isomeric transitions, Jahn-Teller effect, chemical
reactions, Einstein-de Haas effect, superconductivity-superfluidity, and

  the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets with the forming planets and the
  Moon","  Migration of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets,
which was divided into seven regions depending on the distance to the Sun, was
simulated. The influence of gravity of all planets was taken into account. In
some cases, the embryos of the terrestrial planets rather than the planets
themselves were considered; their masses were assumed to be 0.1 or 0.3 of the
current masses of the planets. The arrays of orbital elements of migrated
planetesimals were used to calculate the probabilities of their collisions with
the planets, the Moon, or their embryos. Based on our calculations, we drew
conclusions on the process of accumulation of the terrestrial planets. The
embryos of the terrestrial planets, the masses of which did not exceed a tenth
of the current planetary masses, accumulated planetesimals mainly from the
vicinity of their orbits. When planetesimals fell onto the embryos of the
terrestrial planets from the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn, these embryos
had not yet acquired the current masses of the planets, and the material of
this zone (including water and volatiles) could be accumulated in the inner
layers of the terrestrial planets. The inner layers of each of the terrestrial
planets were mainly formed from the material located in the vicinity of the
orbit of a certain planet. The outer layers of the Earth and Venus could
accumulate the same material for these two planets from different parts of the
feeding zone of the terrestrial planets. The Earth and Venus could acquire more
than half of their masses in 5 Myr. A relatively rapid growth of the bulk of
the Martian mass can be explained by the formation of Mars' embryo (the mass of
which is several times less than that of Mars) due to contraction of a rarefied
condensation.

overcome the challenge of growing large micro-twin-free single crystals of
Mn1.4PtSn which has proved to be the bottleneck for realizing bulk
skyrmionic/antiskyrmionic states in a compound. The use of 5d-transition metal,
platinum, together with manganese as constituents in the Heusler compound such
as Mn1.4PtSn is a precondition for the non-collinear magnetic structure. Due to
the tetragonal inverse Heusler structure, Mn1.4PtSn exhibits large
magneto-crystalline anisotropy and D2d symmetry, which are necessary for
antiskyrmions. The superstructure in Mn1.4PtSn is induced by Mn-vacancies which
enables a ferromagnetic exchange interaction to occur. Mn1.4PtSn, the first
known tetragonal Heusler superstructure compound, opens up a new research
direction for properties related to the superstructure in a family containing
thousands of compounds.

exoplanet terminators. Atmospheric retrievals of transmission spectra are
enabling comparative studies of exoplanet atmospheres. However, the atmospheric
properties inferred by retrieval techniques display a significant anomaly: most
retrieved temperatures are far colder than expected. In some cases, retrieved
temperatures are ~1000 K colder than T_eq. Here, we provide an explanation for
this conundrum. We demonstrate that erroneously cold temperatures result when
1D atmospheric models are applied to spectra of planets with differing
morning-evening terminator compositions. Despite providing an acceptable fit,
1D retrieval techniques artificially tune atmospheric parameters away from
terminator-averaged properties. Retrieved temperature profiles are hundreds of
degrees cooler and have weaker temperature gradients than reality. Retrieved
abundances are mostly biased by > 1$\sigma$ and sometimes by > 3$\sigma$, with
the most extreme biases for ultra-hot Jupiters. When morning-evening
compositional differences manifest for prominent opacity sources, H$_2$O
abundances retrieved by 1D models can be biased by over an order of magnitude.
Finally, we demonstrate that these biases provide an explanation for the cold
retrieved temperatures reported for WASP-17b and WASP-12b. To overcome biases
associated with 1D atmospheric models, there is an urgent need to develop
multidimensional retrieval techniques.

energy density in the dynamics of ultrathin nanowires, which break up into
disjointed clusters when annealed below their melting temperature. The breakup
process is studied for different temperatures and orientations of the nanowire
axis relative to its internal crystal structure using the Monte Carlo kinetic
method. We have also presented an approximate analytical model of the
instability of nanowires. Generally, the interpretation of experimental results
refers to the theoretical model developed by Nichols and Mullins, which is
based on conceptions about the Rayleigh instability of liquid jets. In both
cases, the theories - which do not take into account the anisotropy of surface
energy density - predict the breakup of a nanowire/liquid jet with radius r
into fragments with an average length {\Lambda}=9r. However, the observed
value, {\Lambda}/r, often deviates from 9 either to lower values or to
substantially greater ones (up to 24-30). Our results explain various observed
features of the breakup and the significant variations in the values of its
parameter {\Lambda}/r depending on experimental conditions. In particular, the
ambiguous role of exchange by atoms of the surface of a nanowire with the
surrounding layer of free atoms formed as a result of their rather intensive
sublimation, which occurs in a number of cases, has been investigated. We have
shown that this exchange can lead both to a decrease, and to a significant
increase, in the parameter {\Lambda}/r. The obtained results could be
potentially useful in applications such as the development of optical
waveguides based on ordered nanoparticles chains.

  Ranking","  When ranking big data observations such as colleges in the United States,
diverse consumers reveal heterogeneous preferences. The objective of this paper
is to sort out a linear ordering for these observations and to recommend
strategies to improve their relative positions in the ranking. A properly
sorted solution could help consumers make the right choices, and governments
make wise policy decisions. Previous researchers have applied exogenous
weighting or multivariate regression approaches to sort big data objects,
ignoring their variety and variability. By recognizing the diversity and
heterogeneity among both the observations and the consumers, we instead apply
endogenous weighting to these contradictory revealed preferences. The outcome
is a consistent steady-state solution to the counterbalance equilibrium within
these contradictions. The solution takes into consideration the spillover
effects of multiple-step interactions among the observations. When information
from data is efficiently revealed in preferences, the revealed preferences
greatly reduce the volume of the required data in the sorting process. The
employed approach can be applied in many other areas, such as sports team
ranking, academic journal ranking, voting, and real effective exchange rates.

2003.12228v1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,Mechanism Design for Wireless Powered Spatial Crowdsourcing Networks,"  Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology to prolong the
lifetime of the sensors and communication devices, i.e., workers, in completing
crowdsourcing tasks by providing continuous and cost-effective energy supplies.
In this paper, we propose a wireless powered spatial crowdsourcing framework
which consists of two mutually dependent phases: task allocation phase and data
crowdsourcing phase. In the task allocation phase, we propose a Stackelberg
game based mechanism for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to efficiently
allocate spatial tasks and wireless charging power to each worker. In the data
crowdsourcing phase, the workers may have an incentive to misreport its real
working location to improve its utility, which causes adverse effects to the
spatial crowdsourcing platform. To address this issue, we present three
strategyproof deployment mechanisms for the spatial crowdsourcing platform to
place a mobile base station, e.g., vehicle or robot, which is responsible for
transferring the wireless power and collecting the crowdsourced data. As the
benchmark, we first apply the classical median mechanism and evaluate its
worst-case performance. Then, we design a conventional strategyproof deployment
mechanism to improve the expected utility of the spatial crowdsourcing platform
under the condition that the workers' locations follow a known geographical
distribution. For a more general case with only the historical location data
available, we propose a deep learning based strategyproof deployment mechanism
to maximize the spatial crowdsourcing platform's utility. Extensive
experimental results based on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in allocating tasks and charging power
to workers while avoiding the dishonest worker's manipulation.

screening materials of low background detectors in dark matter and double beta
decay searches due to its high sensitivity to trace $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th.
This work describes a novel co-precipitation approach to measure the amount of
$^{238}$U in high-purity copper to sub-ppt level. Such an approach allows the
pre-concentration of U and removal of the matrix, by selecting a proper
precipitator to co-precipitate with $^{238}$U and using excess ammonia water to
separate the uranium hydroxide from copper by forming water-soluble
tetra-amminecopper (II). The isotope dilution method and standard addition
method were both used to mitigate the matrix effect and cross-check each other.
The latter was also used to measure the recovery efficiency of $^{238}$U by
using $^{233}$U as the tracer. The method detection limit (MDL) reached
$\sim$0.1 pg $^{238}$U /g Cu for both methods while the recovery efficiency of
uranium robustly remains 65\%--85\%. Various sources of interference in the
ICP-MS analysis were thoroughly evaluated, and the contamination from reagents
were found to be the dominant factor that affected the MDL. Further
purification will allow significant improvements in the MDL. This
co-precipitate approach can be easily extended to measure $^{232}$Th by using
$^{229}$Th as the tracer.

2003.12250v1,2020-03-27,2020-03-27,Incorporating Expert Prior in Bayesian Optimisation via Space Warping,"  Bayesian optimisation is a well-known sample-efficient method for the
optimisation of expensive black-box functions. However when dealing with big
search spaces the algorithm goes through several low function value regions
before reaching the optimum of the function. Since the function evaluations are
expensive in terms of both money and time, it may be desirable to alleviate
this problem. One approach to subside this cold start phase is to use prior
knowledge that can accelerate the optimisation. In its standard form, Bayesian
optimisation assumes the likelihood of any point in the search space being the
optimum is equal. Therefore any prior knowledge that can provide information
about the optimum of the function would elevate the optimisation performance.
In this paper, we represent the prior knowledge about the function optimum
through a prior distribution. The prior distribution is then used to warp the
search space in such a way that space gets expanded around the high probability
region of function optimum and shrinks around low probability region of
optimum. We incorporate this prior directly in function model (Gaussian
process), by redefining the kernel matrix, which allows this method to work
with any acquisition function, i.e. acquisition agnostic approach. We show the
superiority of our method over standard Bayesian optimisation method through
optimisation of several benchmark functions and hyperparameter tuning of two
algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random forest.

  Optical archival spectra and further observations from SOAR and OAGH","  Nearly one-third of the sources in the $Fermi$-LAT catalogs lack a lower

sources (UGSs). In order to firmly classify them, dedicated multifrequency
follow-up campaigns are necessary. These will permit to unveil their nature and
identify the fraction that could belong to the class of active galaxies known
as blazars that is the largest population of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray
sources. In $Fermi$-LAT catalogs there are also gamma-ray sources associated
with multifrequency blazar-like objects known as Blazars Candidates of
Uncertain type (i.e., BCUs) for which follow up spectroscopic campaigns are
mandatory to confirm their blazar nature. Thus, in 2013 we started an optical
spectroscopic campaign to identify blazar-like objects potential counterparts
of UGSs and BCUs. Here we report the spectra of 31 additional targets observed
as part of our follow up campaign. Thirteen of them are BCUs for which we
acquired spectroscopic observations at Observatorio Astrof\'isico Guillermo

is an urban system in a grid, outlined by straight streets that form squares,
its layout being the first case of an unfortified colonial city with a regular
plan in the overseas European expansion. It constitutes a historical example of

Natural Science Foundation of China in November 2018 and then by the Strategic
Priority Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences in space sciences in May 2019.
Solar Ring mission will be the first attempt to routinely monitor and study the
Sun and inner heliosphere from a full 360-degree perspective in the ecliptic
plane. The current preliminary design of the Solar Ring mission is to deploy
six spacecraft, grouped in three pairs, on a sub-AU orbit around the Sun. The
two spacecraft in each group are separated by about 30 degrees and every two
groups by about 120 degrees. This configuration with necessary science payloads
will allow us to establish three unprecedented capabilities: (1) determine the
photospheric vector magnetic field with unambiguity, (2) provide 360-degree
maps of the Sun and the inner heliosphere routinely, and (3) resolve the solar
wind structures at multiple scales and multiple longitudes. With these
capabilities, the Solar Ring mission aims to address the origin of solar cycle,
the origin of solar eruptions, the origin of solar wind structures and the
origin of severe space weather events. The successful accomplishment of the
mission will advance our understanding of the star and the space environment

some suitable choice of free parameters, we investigate different interesting
aspects of these wormhole solutions graphically. We also explored the stability
of these wormhole models using equilibrium condition. It can be concluded that
the obtained solutions are stable and physically viable satisfying the wormhole
existence criteria. Lastly, we discuss the constraints for positivity of the

unsupervised feature learning is essential for downstream speech processing

align the feature frames between each word pair, serving as weak top-down

This paper proposes a hybrid categorization technique for separating clickbait

separated using eleven features. After that, the headlines are recategorized
using sentence formality, syntactic similarity measures. In the last phase, the
headlines are again recategorized by applying clustering using word vector
similarity based on t-Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding (t-SNE) approach.
After categorization of these headlines, machine learning models are applied to

results indicate the proposed hybrid model is more robust, reliable and
efficient than any individual categorization techniques for the real-world

with a discrete zero-energy state around one applied flux quantum, {\Phi}_0 =
h/2e, corresponding to 2{\pi} phase winding. Theoretical analysis indicates
that in the presence of radial spin-orbit coupling in the semiconductor, the
winding of the superconducting phase can induce a transition to a topological
phase supporting Majorana zero modes. Realistic modeling shows a topological
phase persisting over a wide range of parameters, and reproduces experimental
tunneling conductance data. Further measurements of Coulomb blockade peak

exponentially decreasing deviation from 1e periodicity with device length,
consistent with Majorana modes at the ends of the nanowire.

external electric field. We show that the valley-orbital locking as well as the
OHE both appear even in the absence of the spin-orbit coupling. The non-zero

through an interacting medium. This process is often simulated by the use of
the Monte Carlo method, which involves the probabilistic determination and
tracking of simulated photon packages. In the regime of high optical depths,
this approach encounters difficulties since a proper representation of the
various physical processes can only be achieved by considering high numbers of
simulated photon packages. As a consequence, the demand for computation time
rises accordingly and thus practically puts a limit on the optical depth of
models that can be simulated. Here we present a method that aims to solve the
problem of high optical depths in dusty media, which relies solely on the use
of unbiased Monte Carlo radiative transfer. For that end, we identified and
precalculated repeatedly occuring and simulated processes, stored their outcome
in a multidimensional cumulative distribution function, and immediately
replaced the basic Monte Carlo transfer during a simulation by that outcome.
During the precalculation, we generated emission spectra as well as deposited
energy distributions of photon packages traveling from the center of a sphere
to its rim. We carried out a performance test of the method to confirm its
validity and gain a boost in computation speed by up to three orders of
magnitude. We then applied the method to a simple model of a viscously heated
circumstellar disk, and we discuss the necessity of finding a solution for the
optical depth problem with regard to a proper temperature calculation. We find
that the impact of an incorrect treatment of photon packages in highly
optically thick regions extents even to optically thin regions, thus, changing
the overall observational appearance of the disk.

mixture in the attractive regime, i.e. for negative values of the interspecies
scattering length $a_{12}$. The binary condensate is prepared in the ground
state and confined in a pure optical trap. We exploit Feshbach resonances for
tuning the value of $a_{12}$. After compensating the gravitational sag between
the two species with a magnetic field gradient, we drive the mixture into the
attractive regime. We let the system to evolve both in free space and in an

observe the formation of self-bound states, recognizable as quantum droplets.
Our findings prove that robust, long-lived droplet states can be realized in
attractive two-species mixtures, despite the two atomic components may
experience different potentials.

  Earth-Like to Super-Earth-Type Exoplanets","  In the present chapter we present the results of evolutionary studies of
exoplanetary atmospheres. We mostly focus on the sub- to super-Earth domain,
although these methods are applicable to all types of exoplanets. We consider
both thermal and nonthermal loss processes. The type of thermal loss mechanism
depends on so-called escape parameter $\beta$, which is the ratio of the
gravitational energy of a particle to its thermal energy. While $\beta$ is
decreasing, an exoplanet switches from classical Jeans to modified Jeans and
finally to blow-off escape mechanisms. During blow-off the majority of the
atmospheric particles dispose of enough energy to escape the planet's gravity
field. This leads to extreme gas losses.
  Although nonthermal losses never exceed blow-off escape, they are of
significant importance for planets with relatively weak Jeans-type escape. From
the diversity of nonthermal escape mechanisms, in the present chapter we focus
on ion pickup and discuss the importance of other loss mechanisms. The general
conclusion of the chapter is, that escape processes strongly shape the
evolution of the exoplanets and determine, if the planet loses its atmosphere
due to erosion processes or, on the contrary, stays as mini-Neptune type body,
which can probably not be considered as a potential habitat as we know it.

specific context and the unconstrained variability of practical scenarios. In
recent years, it has benefited from the powerful features learnt by deep neural
networks, and handcrafted features specialized for abnormality detectors.
However, these approaches with large complexity still have limitations in
handling long term sequential data (e.g., videos), and their learnt features do
not thoroughly capture useful information. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
have been shown to be capable of robustly dealing with temporal data in long
term sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel version of Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU), called Single Tunnelled GRU for abnormality detection.
Particularly, the Single Tunnelled GRU discards the heavy weighted reset gate
from GRU cells that overlooks the importance of past content by only favouring
current input to obtain an optimized single gated cell model. Moreover, we
substitute the hyperbolic tangent activation in standard GRUs with sigmoid
activation, as the former suffers from performance loss in deeper networks.
Empirical results show that our proposed optimized GRU model outperforms
standard GRU and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks on most metrics for
detection and generalization tasks on CUHK Avenue and UCSD datasets. The model
is also computationally efficient with reduced training and testing time over
standard RNNs.

  by a Giant Impact","  The ice-giant planet Uranus likely underwent a giant impact, given that its
spin axis is tilted by 98 degrees. That its satellite system is equally
inclined and prograde suggests that it was formed as a consequence of the
impact. However, the disks predicted by the impact simulations generally have
sizes one order smaller and masses two orders larger than those of the observed
system at present. Here we show, by means of a theoretical model, that the
Uranian satellite formation is regulated by the evolution of the
impact-generated disk. Because the vaporization temperature of water ice is low
and both Uranus and the impactor are assumed to be ice-dominated, we can
conclude that the impact-generated disk has mostly vaporized. We predict that
the disk lost a significant amount of water vapour mass and spread to the
levels of the current system until the disk cooled down enough for ice
condensation and accretion of icy particles to begin. From the predicted
distribution of condensed ices, our N-body simulation is able to reproduce the
observed mass-orbit configuration of Uranian satellites. This scenario
contrasts with the giant-impact model for the Earth's Moon, in which about half
of the compact, impact-generated, solid or liquid disk is immediately
incorporated into the Moon on impact.

spin canting likely originating in frustrated Heisenberg exchange interactions,
and the competition between Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and single-ion anisotropies.

massive stars. Because the strong stellar wind can effectively spin down a
metal-rich massive star with fast rotation, it is very hard to find single
massive stars rotating critically in the Galaxy. In the present work reported
is the discovery of the fastest rotator in the Galaxy, LAMOST

influences of gravitational and thermal forcing. Due to the strong stellar
irradiation, radiative region develops on top of the convective region.
Internal gravity waves are launched at the radiative-convective boundaries
(RCBs). The thermal response is dynamical and plays an important role in the
angular momentum transport. By separating the gravitational and thermal forcing
terms, we identify the thermal effects for increasing the angular momentum
transport. For the low frequency (in the co-rotating frame with planets)
prograde (retrograde) tidal frequency, the angular momentum flux is positive
(negative). The tidal interactions tends to drive the planet to the synchronous
state. We find that the angular momentum transport associated with the internal
gravity wave is very sensitive to relative position between the RCB and the
penetration depth of the thermal forcing. If the RCB is in the vicinity of the
thermal forcing penetration depth, even with small amplitude thermal forcing,
the thermally driven angular momentum flux could be much larger than the flux
induced by gravitational forcing. The thermally enhanced torque could drive the
planet to the synchronous state in as short as a few $10^4$ years.

tool for the assessment of operational conditions is of key importance for
plant management optimization. The objective of the present study was to assess
the potential use of constructed wetland microbial fuel cells (CW-MFC) as a
domestic wastewater COD assessment tool. For the purpose of this work four
lab-scale CW-MFCs were set up and fed with pre-settled domestic wastewater at
different COD concentrations. Under laboratory conditions two different anodic
materials were tested (graphite rods and gravel). Furthermore, a pilot-plant
based experiment was also conducted to confirm the findings previously recorded
for lab-scale experiments. Results showed that in spite of the low coulombic
efficiencies recorded, either gravel or graphite-based anodes were suitable for
the purposes of domestic wastewater COD assessment. Significant linear
relationships could be established between inlet COD concentrations and CW-MFC
Ecell whenever contact time was above 10 hours. Results also showed that the
accuracy of the CW-MFC was greatly compromised after several weeks of
operation. Pilot experiments showed that CW-MFC presents a good bio-indication
response between week 3 and 7 of operation (equivalent to an accumulated
organic loading between 100 and 200 g COD/m2, respectively). Main conclusion of
this work is that of CW-MFC could be used as an ""alarm-tool"" for qualitative

tailoring of the result is necessary. In this paper, we propose
ChangeBeadsThreader (CBT), an interactive environment for splitting and merging
change clusters to support the manual tailoring of untangled changes. CBT
provides two features: 1) a two-dimensional space where fine-grained change
history is visualized to help users find the clusters to be merged and 2) an
augmented diff view that enables users to confirm the consistency of the
changes in a specific cluster for finding those to be split. These features
allow users to easily tailor automatically untangled changes.

  eco-industrial systems","  Industrial symbiosis involves creating integrated cycles of by-products and
waste between networks of industrial actors in order to maximize economic
value, while at the same time minimizing environmental strain. In such a
network, the global environmental strain is no longer equal to the sum of the
environmental strain of the individual actors, but it is dependent on how well
the network performs as a whole. The development of methods to understand,
manage or optimize such networks remains an open issue. In this paper we put
forward a simulation model of by-product flow between industrial actors. The
goal is to introduce a method for modelling symbiotic exchanges from a macro
perspective. The model takes into account the effect of two main mechanisms on
a multi-objective optimization of symbiotic processes. First it allows us to
study the effect of geographical properties of the economic system, said
differently, where actors are divided in space. Second, it allows us to study
the effect of clustering complementary actors together as a function of
distance, by means of a spatial correlation between the actors' by-products.
Our simulations unveil patterns that are relevant for macro-level policy.
First, our results show that the geographical properties are an important
factor for the macro performance of symbiotic processes. Second, spatial
correlations, which can be interpreted as planned clusters such as
Eco-industrial parks, can lead to a very effective macro performance, but only
if these are strictly implemented. Finally, we provide a proof of concept by
comparing the model to real world data from the European Pollutant Release and
Transfer Register database using georeferencing of the companies in the
dataset. This work opens up research opportunities in interactive data-driven
models and platforms to support real-world implementation of industrial
symbiosis.

  distributed in multiple cavities","  Provided that cavities are initially in a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)
entangled state, we show that GHZ states of N-group qubits distributed in N
cavities can be created via a 3-step operation. The GHZ states of the N-group
qubits are generated by using N-group qutrits placed in the N cavities. Here,
""qutrit"" refers to a three-level quantum system with the two lowest levels
representing a qubit while the third level acting as an intermediate state
necessary for the GHZ state creation. This proposal does not depend on the
architecture of the cavity-based quantum network and the way for coupling the
cavities. The operation time is independent of the number of qubits. The GHZ
states are prepared deterministically because no measurement on the states of
qutrits or cavities is needed. In addition, the third energy level of the
qutrits during the entire operation is virtually excited and thus decoherence
from higher energy levels is greatly suppressed. This proposal is quite general
and can in principle be applied to create GHZ states of many qubits using
different types of physical qutrits (e.g., atoms, quantum dots, NV centers,
various superconducting qutrits, etc.) distributed in multiple cavities. As a
specific example, we further discuss the experimental feasibility of preparing
a GHZ state of four-group transmon qubits (each group consisting of three
qubits) distributed in four one-dimensional transmission line resonators
arranged in an array.

opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to
increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables
direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by
providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions.
Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and
automation on the transaction level, through the use of smart contracts, which
are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in
the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few
implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a
knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system
implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by 1) reviewing and
categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, 2) providing an
overview of DLT and its design options, 3) proposing an integrated framework to
match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and 4)
analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case

somewhat lower latitudes on the average than sunspot groups of the odd cycle
wings, i.e., about 0.6 degrees for northern hemisphere wings and 0.8 degrees
for southern hemisphere wings. The spatial analysis of sunspot areas between
SC12-SC23 shows that the small sunspots are at lower solar latitudes of the sun
than the large sunspots for both odd and even cycles, and also for both

after four years (exactly between 4.2-4.5 years), i.e., about 40\% after the

Gnevyshev gap and is occurring at the time when the evolution of the average
sunspot latitudes cross about 15 degrees. The gap is, however, clearer for even

  June 7 Solar Flare","  The most energetic flares start with a filament rise followed by magnetic
reconnection below this filament. The start of the reconnection corresponds to
the beginning of the flare impulsive phase. In this paper we study processes
before this phase. During the filament rise we recognize an unusual radio
continuum with a starting boundary drifting toward lower frequencies. The
estimated velocity of the agent generating this continuum boundary is about 400
km/s, similar to that of the rising filament. In association with this filament
rise, transient X-ray sources and extreme ultaviolet (EUV) brightenings are
found near the filament footpoint and outside the locations where later two
parallel flare ribbons appear. Moreover, oscillations with a ~30 s period are
found simultaneously in radio, EUV, and X-ray observations. Around the end of
these oscillations the flare impulsive phase starts as seen in observations of
the drifting pulsation structure and X-ray source located at the upper part of
the rising filament. We interpret the unusual radio continuum and transient
X-ray sources, which are located outside the two parallel flare ribbons, as
those generated during an interaction of the rising filament with the
above-lying magnetic loops. The EUV brightening at the filament footpoint could
be a signature of the magnetic reconnection inside the magnetic rope carrying
the filament. Possible scenarios of the ~30 s period oscillations in radio,
X-ray, and EUV are discussed.

of SAL the Streaming Analytics Machine (SAM). SAL programs are succinct,
requiring about 20 times fewer lines of code than using the SAM library
directly, or writing an implementation using Apache Flink. To benchmark SAM we
calculate finding temporal triangles within streaming netflow data. Also, we
compare SAM to an implementation written for Flink. We find that SAM is able to
scale to 128 nodes or 2560 cores, while Apache Flink has max throughput with 32
nodes and degrades thereafter. Apache Flink has an advantage when triangles are
rare, with max aggregate throughput for Flink at 32 nodes greater than the max
achievable rate of SAM. In our experiments, when triangle occurrence was faster
than five per second per node, SAM performed better. Both frameworks may miss
results due to latencies in network communication. SAM consistently reported an
average of 93.7% of expected results while Flink decreases from 83.7% to 52.1%
as we increase to the maximum size of the cluster. Overall, SAM can obtain
rates of 91.8 billion netflows per day.

  appraisal of greenhouse states","  The habitable zone is the main tool that mission architectures utilize to
select potentially habitable planets for follow up spectroscopic observation.
Given its importance, the precise size and location of the habitable zone
remains a hot topic, as many studies, using a hierarchy of models, have
assessed various factors including: atmospheric composition, time, and
planetary mass. However, little work has assessed how the habitable zone
changes with variations in background nitrogen pressure, which is directly
connected to the habitability and life bearing potential of planets. Here, I
use an advanced energy balance model with clouds to show that our solar system
habitable zone is about 0.9 to 1.7 AU, assuming a 5 bar nitrogen background
pressure and a maximum 100 percent cloud cover at the inner edge. This width is
about 20 percent wider than the conservative habitable zone estimate. Similar
extensions are calculated for A to M stars. I also show that cooling clouds and
hazes and high background pressures can decrease the runaway greenhouse
threshold temperature to approximately 300 K (or less) for planets orbiting any
star type. This is because the associated increase in planetary albedo enables
stable climates closer to the star, where rapid destabilization can be
triggered from a lower mean surface temperature. Enhanced longwave emission for
planets with very high stratospheric temperatures also permits stable climates
at smaller orbital distances. The model predicts a runaway greenhouse above
approximately 330 K for planets orbiting the Sun, which is consistent with
previous work. However, moist greenhouses only occur for planets orbiting
A-stars.

reduction of irradiation damage during regeneration under typical satellite

  transition in W2As3","  Lifshitz transition represents a sudden reconstruction of Fermi surface
structure, giving rise to anomalies in electronic properties of materials. Such
a transition does not necessarily rely on symmetry-breaking and thus is
topological. It holds a key to understand the origin of many exotic quantum
phenomena, for example the mechanism of extremely large magnetoresistance (MR)
in topological Dirac/Weyl semimetals. Here, we report studies of the
angle-dependent MR (ADMR) and the thermoelectric effect in W2As3 single
crystal. The compound shows a large unsaturated MR (of about 70000% at 4.2 K
and 53 T). The most striking finding is that the ADMR significantly deforms
from the horizontal dumbbell-like shape above 40 K to the vertical lotus-like
pattern below 30 K. The window of 30-40 K also corresponds substantial changes
in Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst coefficient, implying an abrupt change
of Fermi surface topology. Such a temperature-induced Lifshitz transition
results in a compensation of electron-hole transport and the large MR as well.
We thus suggest that the similar method can be applicable in detecting a
Fermi-surface change of a variety of quantum states when a direct Fermi-surface
measurement is not possible.

parameters for these particles may give us a possible hint for CPT violation in
the neutrino sector. Using this approach, we discuss the ability of
long-baseline and atmospheric neutrino experiments to determine the difference
between mass squared splittings ($\Delta m^{2}_{32}-\Delta\bar{m}^{2}_{32}$)
and atmospheric mixing angles ($\sin^{2}\theta_{23}-\sin^{2}\bar{\theta}_{23}$)
of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. We show the joint sensitivity of the T2K, NOvA
and INO experiments to such CPT violating observables in different possible
combinations of octant for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.

Periodic disturbances induced by the repetitive operations must be compensated

compensates a periodic disturbance including the fundamental wave and harmonics
by using a time delay element. Furthermore, an adaptive PDOB is proposed for
the compensation of frequency-varying periodic disturbances. An adaptive notch

2004.00494v1,2020-04-01,2020-04-01,Physical properties and thermal stability of Fe5GeTe2 single crystals,"  The magnetic and transport properties of Fe-deficient Fe5GeTe2 single
crystals (Fe5-xGeTe2 with x~0.3) were studied and the impact of thermal
processing was explored. Quenching crystals from the growth temperature has
been previously shown to produce a metastable state that undergoes a strongly
hysteretic first-order transition upon cooling below ~100K. The first-order
transition impacts the magnetic properties, yielding an enhancement in the
Curie temperature T_C from 270 to 310K. In the present work, T_HT ~550K has
been identified as the temperature above which metastable crystals are obtained
via quenching. Diffraction experiments reveal a structural change at this
temperature, and significant stacking disorder occurs when samples are slowly
cooled through this temperature range. The transport properties are
demonstrated to be similar regardless of the crystal's thermal history. The
scattering of charge carriers appears to be dominated by moments fluctuating on
the Fe(1) sublattice, which remain dynamic down to 100-120K. Maxima in the
magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall resistance are observed near 120K. The
Hall and Seebeck coefficients are also impacted by magnetic ordering on the
Fe(1) sublattice. The data suggest that both electrons and holes contribute to
conduction above 120K, but that electrons dominate at lower temperature when
all of the Fe sublattices are magnetically ordered. This study demonstrates a
strong coupling of the magnetism and transport properties in Fe5-xGeTe2 and
complements the previous results that demonstrated strong magnetoelastic
coupling as the Fe(1) moments order. The published version of this manuscript

very fast into photons. We here show that in a quantum dot set close to a
p-doped reservoir, this absorption can produce a dark duo, i.e., an
electron-hole pair that does not emit light. This unexpected effect relies on
the fact that the wave function for a hole leaks out of a finite-barrier dot
less than for electron. This difference can render the positively charged trio
unstable in the dot by tuning the applied bias voltage in a field-effect
device. The unstable trio that would result from photon absorption in a
positively charged dot, has to eject one of its two holes. The remaining duo
can be made dark with a probability close to 100% after a few pumping cycles
with linearly polarized photons, in this way engineering long-lived initial
states for quantum information processing.

mainly on the \emph{Swift} data in the X-ray energy range obtained during the
time interval 2015\,December--2018\,April. The most extreme X-ray flaring
activity on the long-term, daily and intraday timescales was observed during
the 2-month period which started in 2017\,December when the 0.3--10\,keV flux
exceeded a level of 5$\times$10$^{-9}$erg\,cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, recorded only
twice previously. While the TeV-band and X-ray variabilities mostly were
correlated, the source often varied in a complex manner in the MeV--GeV and
radio--UV energy ranges, indicating that the multifrequency emission of
Mrk\,421 could not be always generated in a single zone. The longer-term flares
at X-rays and $\gamma$-rays showed a lognormal character, possibly indicating a
variability imprint of the accretion disk onto the jet. A vast majority of the
0.3--10\,keV spectra were consistent with the log-parabolic model, showing
relatively low spectral curvature and correlations between the different
spectral parameters, predicted in the case of the first and second-order Fermi
processes. The position of the synchrotron spectral energy distribution (SED)
peak showed an extreme variability on diverse timescales between the energies
$E_{\rm p}$$<$0.1\,keV and $E_{\rm p}$$>$15\,keV, with 15\% of the spectra
peaking at hard X-rays and was related to the peak height as $S_{\rm

2004.01749v1,2020-04-02,2020-04-02,Typosquatting for Fun and Profit: Cross-Country Analysis of Pop-Up Scam,"  Today, many different types of scams can be found on the internet. Online
criminals are always finding new creative ways to trick internet users, be it
in the form of lottery scams, downloading scam apps for smartphones or fake
gambling websites. This paper presents a large-scale study on one particular
delivery method of online scam: pop-up scam on typosquatting domains.
Typosquatting describes the concept of registering domains which are very
similar to existing ones while deliberately containing common typing errors;
these domains are then used to trick online users while under the belief of
browsing the intended website. Pop-up scam uses JavaScript alert boxes to
present a message which attracts the user's attention very effectively, as they
are a blocking user interface element.
  Our study among typosquatting domains derived from the Majestic Million list
utilising an Austrian IP address revealed on 1219 distinct typosquatting URLs a
total of 2577 pop-up messages, out of which 1538 were malicious. Approximately
a third of those distinct URLs (403) were targeted and displayed pop-up
messages to one specific HTTP user agent only. Based on our scans, we present
an in-depth analysis as well as a detailed classification of different
targeting parameters (user agent and language) which triggered varying kinds of
pop-up scams. Furthermore, we expound the differences of current pop-up scam
characteristics in comparison with a previous scan performed in late 2018 and
examine the use of IDN homograph attacks as well as the application of message
localisation using additional scans with IP addresses from the United States

  indices in q-space trajectory imaging","  Diffusion anisotropy in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is commonly quantified
with normalized diffusion anisotropy indices (DAIs). Most often, the fractional
anisotropy (FA) is used, but several alternative DAIs have been introduced in
attempts to maximize the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in diffusion anisotropy
maps. Examples include the scaled relative anisotropy (sRA), the gamma variate
anisotropy index (GV), the surface anisotropy (UAsurf), and the lattice index
(LI). With the advent of multidimensional diffusion encoding it became possible
to determine the presence of microscopic diffusion anisotropy in a voxel, which
is theoretically independent of orientation coherence. In accordance with DTI,
the microscopic anisotropy is typically quantified by the microscopic
fractional anisotropy (uFA). In this work, in addition to the uFA, the four
microscopic diffusion anisotropy indices (uDAIs) usRA, uGV, uUAsurf, and uLI
are defined in analogy to the respective DAIs by means of the average diffusion
tensor and the covariance tensor. Simulations with three representative
distributions of microscopic diffusion tensors revealed distinct CNR
differences when differentiating between isotropic and microscopically
anisotropic diffusion. q-Space trajectory imaging (QTI) was employed to acquire
brain in-vivo maps of all indices. For this purpose, a 15 min protocol
featuring linear, planar, and spherical tensor encoding was used. The resulting
maps were of good quality and exhibited different contrasts, e.g. between gray
and white matter. This indicates that it may be beneficial to use more than one
uDAI in future investigational studies.

versatile use in unidirectional invisibility, lasing, sensing, etc. Broken and
unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric states in non-Hermitian open systems are

of the open system, has no certain definition of the scattering matrix, since
the output ports can be permuted. The uncertainty in definition of the
exceptional points bordering $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-broken states poses an important problem, because the
exceptional points are indispensable in applications as sensing and mode
discrimination. Here we derive the proper scattering matrix from the
unambiguous relation between the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian and
scattering matrix. We reveal that the exceptional points of the scattering
matrix with permuted output ports are not related to the $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry breaking. Nevertheless, they can be employed for finding a lasing
onset as demonstrated in our time-domain calculations and scattering-matrix
pole analysis. Our results are important for various applications of the
non-Hermitian systems including encircling exceptional points, coherent perfect
absorption, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric plasmonics, etc.

thickness of approximately 20 nm. For Ru films with thicknesses above 20 nm,
transmission electron microscopy evidences threading and misfit dislocations,
stacking faults and deformation twins. Exposure of Co films to ambient air, and
the deposition of oxide layers of SiO2, MgO, Al2O3 and Cr2O3 on Ru degrade the
surface specularity of the metallic layer. However, for the Ru films, annealing
in a reducing ambient restores the surface specularity. Epitaxial
electrochemical deposition of Co on epitaxially-deposited Ru layers is used as
an example to demonstrate the feasibility of generating epitaxial interconnects

tight-binding approach is described, with Ru interconnects used an example. The
model allows conductivity to be computed for structures comprising large
ensembles of atoms (10^5-10^6), scales linearly with system size and can also

nanocomposite of 60% Bi:40% RGO is a beneficial anode material, delivering a
discharge capacity as high as 413 and 372 mAh per g at the specific current of
39 mA per g in the 1st and 50th cycles, respectively. In addition, it shows
high-rate capability with the discharge capacities of 381, 372, 354, 295, and
238 mAh per g at the specific currents of 53, 100, 200, 500, and 700 mA per g,

three-dimensional (3D) mUTE sequence to acquire signals from water, fat, and
short-T2 components (e.g., bones) simultaneously in a single acquisition. The
proposed mUTE sequence integrates 3D UTE with multi-echo Dixon acquisitions and
uses sparse radial trajectories to accelerate imaging speed. Errors in the
radial k-space trajectories are measured using a special k-space trajectory
mapping sequence and corrected for image reconstruction. A physical
compartmental model is used to fit the measured multi-echo MR signals to obtain
fractions of water, fat and bone components for each voxel, which are then used
to estimate the continuous LAC map for PET attenuation correction. The
performance of the proposed method was evaluated via phantom and in vivo human
studies, using LACs from Computed Tomography (CT) as reference. Compared to
Dixon- and atlas-based MRAC methods, the proposed method yielded PET images
with higher correlation and similarity in relation to the reference. The
relative absolute errors of PET activity values reconstructed by the proposed
method were below 5% in all of the four lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal,
occipital), cerebellum, whole white matter and gray matter regions across all
subjects (n=6). The proposed mUTE method can generate subject-specific,

questioned the adequacy of traditional tools in explaining periods of financial
distress, as well as the adequacy of the existing policy response. In
particular, the effect of complex interconnections among financial institutions
on financial stability has been widely recognized. A recent debate focused on
the effects of unconventional policies aimed at achieving both price and
financial stability. In particular, Quantitative Easing (QE, i.e., the
large-scale asset purchase programme conducted by a central bank upon the
creation of new money) has been recently implemented by the European Central
Bank (ECB). In this context, two questions deserve more attention in the
literature. First, to what extent, by injecting liquidity, the QE may alter the
bank-firm lending level and stimulate the real economy. Second, to what extent
the QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial
actors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension
funds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we
address these two questions by developing a methodology to map the
macro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across
financial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our
approach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public
securities purchased within the QE). We then test the effect of the
implementation of ECB's QE on the time evolution of the financial linkages in
the macro-network of the euro area, as well as the effect on macroeconomic
variables, such as output and prices.

anomalous band structure manifested by topological properties that lead to some
unusual and unique physical properties. We investigate novel features of
surface plasmon polaritons in a slot waveguide comprised from two semi-infinite
Weyl semimetals. We consider symmetric Voigt-Voigt and Faraday-Faraday
configurations for plasmon polaritons in two interfaces of waveguide and show
that the resulting dispersion is symmetric and the propagation of surface
plasmon polaritons is bidirectional. We introduce exotic and novel asymmetric
structures making use of difference in magnitude or orientation of chiral
anomalies in two Weyl semimetals in both Voigt and Faraday configurations.
These structures show a tremendous nonreciprocal dispersion and unidirectional
propagation of surface plasmon polaritons. Moreover, we study an hybrid
configuration of Voigt-Faraday for surface plasmon polartions in two interfaces
of the waveguide. We find that this structure possesses unique futures. It
shows surface plasmon polariton modes with unidirectional propagation above the
bulk plasmon frequency. Furthermore, we find a surface plasmon polariton band
which admits the Voigt and Faraday features simultaneously. Also, we show that
the waveguide thickness and the chemical potential of the Weyl semimetals can
be used as a fine-tuning parameters in these structures. Our findings may be
employed in optical devices which exploit the unidirectional surface plasmon
propagation features.

spins due to spin-orbit interaction thus exhibiting various emergent phenomena
as they interact with chiral materials, which otherwise would not be observed
in achiral systems. This new paradigm allows the potential development of new
forms of devices or methods by utilizing reciprocal interaction of chiral
objects with moving electron spins. This review updates the remarkable

paper, we revisit this observation from a formal standpoint. We develop United
Linear Logic (ULL), a logic encompassing both classical and intuitionistic
linear logic. Then, following the Curry-Howard correspondences for session
types, we define piULL, a session type system for the pi-calculus based on ULL.
Using piULL we can formally assess the difference between the intuitionistic

2004.01321v1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,Generating Interactive WebSocket Applications in TypeScript,"  Advancements in mobile device computing power have made interactive web
applications possible, allowing the web browser to render contents dynamically
and support low-latency communication with the server. This comes at a cost to
the developer, who now needs to reason more about correctness of communication
patterns in their application as web applications support more complex
communication patterns.
  Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a framework for verifying conformance
of implementations to their prescribed communication protocol. Existing
proposals for applying the MPST framework in application developments either
neglect the event-driven nature of web applications, or lack compatibility with
industry tools and practices, which discourages mainstream adoption by web
developers.
  In this paper, we present an implementation of the MPST framework for
developing interactive web applications using familiar industry tools using
TypeScript and the React.js framework. The developer can use the Scribble
protocol language to specify the protocol and use the Scribble toolchain to
validate and obtain the local protocol for each role. The local protocol
describes the interactions of the global communication protocol observed by the
role. We encode the local protocol into TypeScript types, catering for
server-side and client-side targets separately. We show that our encoding
guarantees that only implementations which conform to the protocol can
type-check. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
web-based implementation of the classic Noughts and Crosses game from an MPST
formalism of the game logic.

where the Hall effect due to the Berry phase can be most pronounced. With small
gaps there, the adiabatic limit for the existing formulations of Hall current
can be exceeded in a moderate electric field. Here we present a theory of
non-adiabatic Hall effect, capturing non-perturbatively the across gap
electron-hole excitations by the electric field. We find a general connection

In coherent evolution, the electron-hole coherence can manifest as a sizeable
ac Hall velocity. When environmental noise is taken into account, its joint
action with the electric field favors a form of electron-hole coherence that is
function of wavevector and field only, leading to a dc nonlinear Hall effect.
The Hall current has all odd order terms in field, and still retains the
intrinsic role of the Berry curvature. The quantitative demonstration uses the
example of gapped Dirac cones, and our theory can be used to describe the bulk
pseudospin Hall current in insulators with gapped edge such as graphene and 2D

given input, an output is produced in accordance with the program. The outputs
generated by quantum computers that fulfill these requirements are not
temporally correlated, however. In a quantum-computing device comprising
solid-state qubits such as superconducting qubits, any operation to rest the
qubits to their initial state faces a practical problem. We applied a
statistical analysis to a collection of random numbers output from a 20-qubit
superconducting-qubit cloud quantum computer using the simplest random number
generation scheme. The analysis indicates temporal correlation in the output of
some sequences obtained from the 20 qubits. This temporal correlation is not
related to the relaxation time of each qubit. We conclude that the correlation
could be a result of a systematic error.

2004.01331v1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,Growing Random Graphs with Quantum Rules,"  Random graphs are a central element of the study of complex dynamical
networks such as the internet, the brain, or socioeconomic phenomena. New
methods to generate random graphs can spawn new applications and give insights
into more established techniques. We propose two variations of a model to grow
random graphs and trees, based on continuous-time quantum walks on the graphs.
After a random characteristic time, the position of the walker(s) is measured
and new nodes are attached to the nodes where the walkers collapsed. Such
dynamical systems are reminiscent of the class of spontaneous collapse theories
in quantum mechanics. We investigate several rates of this spontaneous collapse
for an individual quantum walker and for two non-interacting walkers. We
conjecture (and report some numerical evidence) that the models are scale-free.

2004.01332v1,2020-04-03,2020-04-03,Projection Theorem for Discrete-Time Quantum Walks,"  We make and generalize the observation that summing of probability amplitudes
of a discrete-time quantum walk over partitions of the walking graph consistent
with the step operator results in a unitary evolution on the reduced graph
which is also a quantum walk. Since the effective walking graph of the
projected walk is not necessarily simpler than the original, this may bring new
insights into the dynamics of some kinds of quantum walks using known results
from thoroughly studied cases like Euclidean lattices. We use abstract
treatment of the walking space and walker displacements in aim for a generality
of the presented statements. Using this approach we also identify some
pathological cases in which the projection mapping breaks down. For walks on
lattices, the operation typically results in quantum walks with
hyper-dimensional coin spaces. Such walks can, conversely, be viewed as
projections of walks on inaccessible, larger spaces, and their properties can
be inferred from the parental walk. We show that this is is the case for a lazy
quantum walk, a walk with large coherent jumps and a walk on a circle with a
twisted boundary condition. We also discuss the relation of this theory to the
time-multiplexing optical implementations of quantum walks. Moreover, this
manifestly irreversible operation can, in some cases and with a minor
adjustment, be undone, and a quantum walk can be reconstructed from a set of
its projections.

driven by the dissipative interaction with external environments and are
formulated as completely positive trace-preserving maps on graphs. A
generalized quantum optical scheme for implementing OQWs that includes non-zero
temperature of the environment is suggested. In the proposed quantum optical
scheme, a two-level atom plays the role of the ""walker"", and the Fock states of
the cavity mode correspond to the lattice sites for the ""walker"". Using the
small unitary rotations approach the effective dynamics of the system is shown
to be an OQW. For the chosen set of parameters, an increase in the temperature
of the environment causes the system to reach the asymptotic distribution much
faster compared to the scheme proposed earlier where the temperature of the
environment is zero. For this case the asymptotic distribution is given by a
steady Gaussian distribution.

describes only the average dynamics of this variable, not its fluctuations. It
is shown that a general unbiased quantum measurement can be reformulated as a

around 9 meV along with another partially overlapped in-plane mode around 12
meV. We argue that such spin anisotropy is induced by the spin-orbit coupling
in the spin-vortex-type fluctuations of this unique compound. The spin
anisotropy is strongly affected by the superconductivity, where it is weak
below 6 meV in the normal state and then transferred to higher energy and
further enhanced in the odd mode of spin resonance below $T_c$.

are considered a major health-care challenge. One major driver for the rapid
spatial spread of diseases is human mobility. In particular, the travel
patterns of individuals determine their spreading potential to a great extent.
These travel behaviors can be captured and modelled using novel location-based
data sources, e.g., smart travel cards, social media, etc. Previous studies
have shown that individuals who cannot be characterized by their most
frequently visited locations spread diseases farther and faster; however, these
studies are based on GPS data and mobile call records which have position
uncertainty and do not capture explicit contacts. It is unclear if the same
conclusions hold for large scale real-world transport networks. In this paper,
we investigate how mobility patterns impact disease spread in a large-scale

findings, our results reveal that individuals with mobility patterns
characterized by their most frequently visited locations and who typically
travel large distances pose the highest spreading risk.

objects and to find compact cores on parsec scales. VLBI imaging could also be
employed to look for dual AGNs when the sources show kpc-scale double symmetric

we focus on two aspects of challenges: i) Since salient objects appear in
various sizes, using single-scale convolution would not capture the right size.
Moreover, using multi-scale convolutions without considering their importance
may confuse the model. ii) Employing multi-level features helps the model use
both local and global context. However, treating all features equally results
in information redundancy. Therefore, there needs to be a mechanism to
intelligently select which features in different levels are useful. To address
the first challenge, we propose a Multi-scale Attention Guided Module. This
module not only extracts multi-scale features effectively but also gives more
attention to more discriminative feature maps corresponding to the scale of the

2004.01870v1,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,The hazard from fragmenting comets,"  Comet disintegration proceeds both through sublimation and discrete splitting
events. The cross-sectional area of material ejected by a comet may, within
days, become many times greater than that of the Earth, making encounters with
such debris much more likely than collisions with the nucleus itself. The
hierarchic fragmentation and sublimation of a large comet in a short period
orbit may yield many hundreds of such short-lived clusters. We model this
evolution with a view to assessing the probability of an encounter which might
have significant terrestrial effects, through atmospheric dusting or multiple
impacts. Such an encounter may have contributed to the large animal extinctions
and sudden climatic cooling of 12,900 years ago, and the near-simultaneous
collapse of civilisations around 2350 BC.

  Segmentation","  Gliomas are the most common and aggressive among brain tumors, which cause a
short life expectancy in their highest grade. Therefore, treatment assessment
is a key stage to enhance the quality of the patients' lives. Recently, deep
convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved a remarkable performance in
brain tumor segmentation, but this task is still difficult owing to high
varying intensity and appearance of gliomas. Most of the existing methods,
especially UNet-based networks, integrate low-level and high-level features in
a naive way, which may result in confusion for the model. Moreover, most
approaches employ 3D architectures to benefit from 3D contextual information of
input images. These architectures contain more parameters and computational
complexity than 2D architectures. On the other hand, using 2D models causes not
to benefit from 3D contextual information of input images. In order to address
the mentioned issues, we design a low-parameter network based on 2D UNet in
which we employ two techniques. The first technique is an attention mechanism,
which is adopted after concatenation of low-level and high-level features. This
technique prevents confusion for the model by weighting each of the channels
adaptively. The second technique is the Multi-View Fusion. By adopting this
technique, we can benefit from 3D contextual information of input images

on the first spiral arm beyond the Perseus arm, often called the Cygnus arm or
the Outer Norma arm, by appraising the distributions of the masers near the
Cygnus arm. The method is to employ masers whose trigonometric distances were
measured with accuracy. The maser data come from published literature, having
been obtained via the existing networks (US VLBA, the Japanese VERA, the
European VLBI, and the Australian LBA). The new results for Cygnus are split in
two groups: those located near a recent CO fitted global model spiral arm, and
those congregating within an interarm island located halfway between the
Perseus arm and the Cygnus arm. Next, we compare this island with other similar
interarm objects near other spiral arms. Thus we delineate an interarm island
(6 x 2 kpc) located between the two long spiral arms (Cygnus and Perseus arms);
this is reminiscent of the small Local Orion arm (4 x 2 kpc) found earlier
between the Perseus and Sagittarius arms, and of the old Loop (2 x 0.5 kpc)
found earlier between the Sagittarius and Scutum arms. Various arm models are
compared, based on observational data (masers, HII regions, HI gas, young

  Networks and a Neuro-Fuzzy System","  Generating music with emotion similar to that of an input video is a very
relevant issue nowadays. Video content creators and automatic movie directors
benefit from maintaining their viewers engaged, which can be facilitated by
producing novel material eliciting stronger emotions in them. Moreover, there's
currently a demand for more empathetic computers to aid humans in applications
such as augmenting the perception ability of visually and/or hearing impaired
people. Current approaches overlook the video's emotional characteristics in
the music generation step, only consider static images instead of videos, are
unable to generate novel music, and require a high level of human effort and
skills. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep neural network that uses
an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System to predict a video's emotion from its
visual features and a deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network to
generate its corresponding audio signals with similar emotional inkling. The
former is able to appropriately model emotions due to its fuzzy properties, and
the latter is able to model data with dynamic time properties well due to the
availability of the previous hidden state information. The novelty of our
proposed method lies in the extraction of visual emotional features in order to
transform them into audio signals with corresponding emotional aspects for
users. Quantitative experiments show low mean absolute errors of 0.217 and
0.255 in the Lindsey and DEAP datasets respectively, and similar global
features in the spectrograms. This indicates that our model is able to
appropriately perform domain transformation between visual and audio features.
Based on experimental results, our model can effectively generate audio that
matches the scene eliciting a similar emotion from the viewer in both datasets,
and music generated by our model is also chosen more often.

stellar diameters. Here we present a set of precision diameters and
temperatures for a sample of 6 dwarf, 5 sub-giant, and 5 giant stars observed

least two sequences with five unique calibration stars each for accurate
visibility calibration and to reduce the impact of bad calibrators. We use the
standard PIONIER data reduction pipeline, but bootstrap over interferograms, in
addition to employing a Monte-Carlo approach to account for correlated errors
by sampling stellar parameters, limb darkening coefficients, and fluxes, as
well as predicted calibrator angular diameters. The resulting diameters were
then combined with bolometric fluxes derived from broadband Hipparcos-Tycho
photometry and MARCS model bolometric corrections, plus parallaxes from Gaia to
produce effective temperatures, physical radii, and luminosities for each star
observed. Our stars have mean angular diameter and temperatures uncertainties
of 0.8% and 0.9% respectively, with our sample including diameters for 10 stars

2004.02396v1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,A Learning Framework for n-bit Quantized Neural Networks toward FPGAs,"  The quantized neural network (QNN) is an efficient approach for network
compression and can be widely used in the implementation of FPGAs. This paper
proposes a novel learning framework for n-bit QNNs, whose weights are
constrained to the power of two. To solve the gradient vanishing problem, we
propose a reconstructed gradient function for QNNs in back-propagation
algorithm that can directly get the real gradient rather than estimating an
approximate gradient of the expected loss. We also propose a novel QNN
structure named n-BQ-NN, which uses shift operation to replace the multiply
operation and is more suitable for the inference on FPGAs. Furthermore, we also
design a shift vector processing element (SVPE) array to replace all 16-bit
multiplications with SHIFT operations in convolution operation on FPGAs. We
also carry out comparable experiments to evaluate our framework. The
experimental results show that the quantized models of ResNet, DenseNet and
AlexNet through our learning framework can achieve almost the same accuracies
with the original full-precision models. Moreover, when using our learning
framework to train our n-BQ-NN from scratch, it can achieve state-of-the-art
results compared with typical low-precision QNNs. Experiments on Xilinx ZCU102
platform show that our n-BQ-NN with our SVPE can execute 2.9 times faster than
with the vector processing element (VPE) in inference. As the SHIFT operation

2004.02400v1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,Resource Efficient Isolation Mechanisms in Mixed-Criticality Scheduling,"  Mixed-criticality real-time scheduling has been developed to improve resource
utilization while guaranteeing safe execution of critical applications. These
studies use optimistic resource reservation for all the applications to improve
utilization, but prioritize critical applications when the reservations become
insufficient at runtime. Many of them however share an impractical assumption
that all the critical applications will simultaneously demand additional
resources. As a consequence, they under-utilize resources by penalizing all the
low-criticality applications. In this paper we overcome this shortcoming using
a novel mechanism that comprises a parameter to model the expected number of
critical applications simultaneously demanding more resources, and an execution
strategy based on the parameter to improve resource utilization. Since most
mixed-criticality systems in practice are component-based, we design our
mechanism such that the component boundaries provide the isolation necessary to
support the execution of low-criticality applications, and at the same time
protect the critical ones. We also develop schedulability tests for the
proposed mechanism under both a flat as well as a hierarchical scheduling
framework. Finally, through simulations, we compare the performance of the
proposed approach with existing studies in terms of schedulability and the
capability to support low-criticality applications.

  single-mode PPLN waveguide","  Terahertz (THz)-bandwidth continuous-wave (CW) squeezed light is essential
for integrating quantum processors with time-domain multiplexing (TDM) by using
optical delay line interferometers. Here, we utilize a single-pass optical
parametric amplifier (OPA) based on a single-spatial-mode periodically poled
ZnO:LiNbO3 waveguide, which is directly bonded onto a LiTaO3 substrate. The
single-pass OPA allows THz bandwidth, and the absence of higher-order spatial
modes in the single-spatial-mode structure helps to avoid degradation of
squeezing. In addition, the directly bonded ZnO-doped waveguide has durability
for high-power pump and shows small photorefractive damage. Using this
waveguide, we observe CW 6.3-dB squeezing at 20-MHz sideband by balanced
homodyne detection. This is the first realization of CW squeezing with a
single-pass OPA at a level exceeding 4.5 dB, which is required for the
generation of a two-dimensional cluster state. Furthermore, the squeezed light
shows 2.5-THz spectral bandwidth. The squeezed light will lead to the
development of a high-speed on-chip quantum processor using TDM with a
centimeter-order optical delay line.

2004.02439v1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,Optimal Virtual Cluster-based Multiprocessor Scheduling,"  Scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic task systems on multiprocessor
platforms is an area which has received much attention in the recent past. It
is widely believed that finding an optimal scheduler is hard, and therefore
most studies have focused on developing algorithms with good processor
utilization bounds. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two
categories: partitioned scheduling in which tasks are statically assigned to
individual processors, and global scheduling in which each task is allowed to
execute on any processor in the platform. In this paper we consider a third,
more general, approach called cluster-based scheduling. In this approach each
task is statically assigned to a processor cluster, tasks in each cluster are
globally scheduled among themselves, and clusters in turn are scheduled on the
multiprocessor platform. We develop techniques to support such cluster-based
scheduling algorithms, and also consider properties that minimize total
processor utilization of individual clusters. In the last part of this paper,
we develop new virtual cluster-based scheduling algorithms. For implicit
deadline sporadic task systems, we develop an optimal scheduling algorithm that
is neither Pfair nor ERfair. We also show that the processor utilization bound
of US-EDF{m/(2m-1)} can be improved by using virtual clustering. Since neither
partitioned nor global strategies dominate over the other, cluster-based
scheduling is a natural direction for research towards achieving improved
processor utilization bounds.

continued by discussing the closely related notions of composition of systems,
subsystems, and their independence. Physical subsystems have a neat algebraic
description as subgroupoids of the Schwinger's groupoid of the system. The
groupoids picture offers two natural notions of composition of systems: Direct
and free products of groupoids, that will be analyzed in depth as well as their
universal character. Finally, the notion of independence of subsystems will be
reviewed, finding that the usual notion of independence, as well as the notion
of free independence, find a natural realm in the groupoids formalism. The
ideas described in this paper will be illustrated by using the EPRB experiment.
It will be observed that, in addition to the notion of the non-separability
provided by the entangled state of the system, there is an intrinsic
`non-separability' associated to the impossibility of identifying the entangled
particles as subsystems of the total system.

(1-0) intensity ratios consistent with those of many AGN but whose mid-infrared
spectral diagnostics are consistent with little to no ( $\lesssim15\% $)
contribution of an AGN to the bolometric luminosity. To search for putative
heavily obscured AGN, we present and analyze \nustar hard X-ray (3-79 keV)
observations of four such galaxies from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG
Survey. We find no X-ray evidence for AGN in three of the systems and place
strong upper limits on the energetic contribution of any heavily obscured
($N_{\rm H}>10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN to their bolometric luminosity. The X-ray
flux upper limits are presently an order of magnitude below what XDR-driven
chemistry model predict are necessary to drive HCN enhancements. In a fourth
system we find a hard X-ray excess consistent with the presence of an AGN, but
contributing only $\sim3\%$ of the bolometric luminosity. It is also unclear if
the AGN is spatially associated with the HCN enhancement. We further explore
the relationship between HCN/HCO$^+$ (for several $\mathrm{J}_\mathrm{upper}$
levels) and $L_\mathrm{AGN}/L_\mathrm{IR}$ for a larger sample of systems in
the literature. We find no evidence for correlations between the line ratios

ratios are not driven by the energetic dominance of AGN, nor are they reliable
indicators of whether SMBH accretion is ongoing.

2004.02953v2,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,Electron-polaron dichotomy of charge carriers in perovskite oxides,"  Many transition metal oxides (TMOs) are Mott insulators due to strong Coulomb
repulsion between electrons, and exhibit metal-insulator transitions (MITs)
whose mechanisms are not always fully understood. Unlike most TMOs, minute
doping in CaMnO3 induces a metallic state without any structural
transformations. This material is thus an ideal platform to explore band
formation through the MIT. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy to visualize how electrons delocalize and couple to phonons in
CaMnO3. We show the development of a Fermi surface where mobile electrons
coexist with heavier carriers, strongly coupled polarons. The latter originate
from a boost of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI). This finding brings to

  Survey and First Results","  The Kepler mission has provided a treasure trove of eclipsing binaries (EBs),
observed at extremely high photometric precision, nearly continuously for
several years. We are carrying out a survey of ~100 of these EBs to derive
dynamical masses and radii with precisions of 3% or better. We use multiplexed
near-infrared H band spectroscopy from the SDSS-III and -IV APOGEE instrument
and optical spectroscopy from the HET High-Resolution Spectrograph to derive
double-lined spectroscopic orbits and dynamical mass-ratios for the EB sample.
This information is combined with Kepler photometry to derive orbital
inclination, dynamical masses of the components, radii and temperatures. These
measurements are directly applicable for benchmarking stellar models that are
integrating the next generation of improvements, such as the magnetic
suppression of convection efficiency, updated opacity tables, and fine-tuned
equations of state. We selected our EB sample to include systems with low-mass
($M \lt 0.8 \; M_{\odot}$) primary or secondary components, many expected to
populate the relatively sparse parameter space below $0.5 \; M_{\odot}$. In
this paper, we describe our EB sample and the analysis techniques we are
utilizing, and present masses and radii for two systems that inhabit
particularly underpopulated regions of mass-radius-period space: KIC 2445134
and KIC 3003991. Our analysis of KIC 2445134 ($q=0.411 \pm 0.001$) yields

belong to the largest population of $\gamma$-ray sources: blazars. This class
of AGNs shows a double-bumped spectral energy distribution that is commonly
described in terms of a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission process,
whereas the low-energy component that dominates their emission between the
infrared and the X-ray band is tightly connected to the high-energy component
that peaks in the $\gamma$-rays. Two strong connections that link radio and
mid-infrared emission of blazars to the emission in the $\gamma$-ray band are
well established. They constitute the basis for associating $\gamma$-ray
sources with their low-energy counterparts. We searched for a possible link
between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions for the subclass of BL Lacs using all
archival Swift/XRT observations combined with Fermi data for a selected sample
of 351 sources. Analyzing $\sim$2400 ks of Swift/XRT observations that were

2004.05982v1,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,The explosive life of massive binaries,"  Massive stars are born predominantly as members of binary (or higher
multiplicity) systems, and the presence of a companion can significantly alter
their life and final fate. Therefore, any observed sample of massive stars or
associated transients is likely to be significantly influenced by the effects
of binarity. Here, we focus on the relationship between massive binary
evolution and core-collapse supernova events. In the vast majority of the
cases, the first core-collapse event happening in a binary system unbinds the
two stars. Studying the population of companion stars, either at the supernova
site, or as ""widowed"" stars long after the explosion, can be used to constrain
the previous orbital evolution of the binary progenitor, and explosion physics
of their former companion. Specifically, the population of ""widowed"" stars
might provide statistical constraints on the typical amplitude of black hole
natal kicks without seeing neither the black holes nor the transient possibly
associated with their formation. Binarity also has a large impact on the
predicted population of supernova sub-types, including hydrogen-rich type II
supernovae, with a significant fraction of hydrogen-rich stars at explosions
being either merger products or accretors.

vanishes, while both $T_{\rm{c}}$ and the resistivity $A$-coefficient reach a
maximum value around this pressure. Our results suggest that the occurrence of

with energy of $\hbar\omega_\text{res}=0.56$~meV centered at a characteristic

corresponds well to the superconducting gap $2\Delta=0.56$~meV estimated by the
tunneling spectroscopy. The spin resonance shows the $L$ modulation with a
maximum at around $L = 0.5$. The $L$ modulated intensity of the spin resonance
and our RPA calculations indicate that the superconducting gaps regarding the
quasi-one-dimensional $\alpha$ and $\beta$ sheets at the Fermi surfaces have
the horizontal line nodes. These results may set a strong constraint on the

  the $L_{\text{X}}-T$ scaling relation","  The isotropy of the late Universe is an assumption greatly used in astronomy.
However, many studies have recently reported deviations from isotropy with a
definitive conclusion yet to be made. New, independent methods to robustly test
the cosmic isotropy are of crucial importance. In this work, we investigate the
directional behavior of the X-ray luminosity-temperature ($L_X-T$) relation of
galaxy clusters. A tight correlation exists between the luminosity and
temperature of the X-ray-emitting intracluster medium. While the measured
luminosity depends on the underlying cosmology, the temperature can be
determined without any cosmological assumptions. By exploiting this property
one can effectively test the isotropy of cosmological parameters over the full
extragalactic sky. Here, we used 313 homogeneously selected X-ray galaxy
clusters from the MCXC catalog and obtained core-excised temperatures for all
of them. We find that the behavior of the $L_X-T$ relation heavily depends on
the direction of the sky. Strong anisotropies are detected at a $\sim 4\sigma$
level toward $(l,b)\sim (280^{\circ}, -20^{\circ})$. Several X-ray and
cluster-related effects that could potentially explain these anisotropies were
examined, but none did so. Interestingly, two other available cluster samples
appear to have a similar behavior throughout the sky, while being fully
independent of each other and our sample. Performing a joint analysis of the
three samples, the final anisotropy is further intensified ($\sim 5\sigma$),
toward $(l,b)\sim (303^{\circ}, -27^{\circ})$, which is in good agreement with
other cosmological probes. This result demonstrates that X-ray galaxy cluster
studies that assume perfect isotropy can produce strongly biased results
whether the underlying reason is cosmological or related to X-rays. The
identification of the exact nature of these anisotropies is therefore crucial.

point-of-care diagnosis. This raises the need for an independent diagnostic of
diabetic retinopathy that can be used by a non-expert. Recently the usage of
smartphones has been increasing across the world. Automated diagnoses of
diabetic retinopathy can be deployed on smartphones in order to provide an
instant diagnosis to diabetic people residing in remote areas. In this paper,
inception based convolutional neural network and binary decision tree-based
ensemble of classifiers have been proposed and implemented to detect and
classify diabetic retinopathy. The proposed method was further imported into a
smartphone application for mobile-based classification, which provides an
offline and automatic system for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.

  Crystal Diamond","  Sculpturing desired shapes in single crystal diamond is ever more crucial in
the realization of complex devices for nanophotonics, quantum computing, and
quantum optics. The crystallographic orientation dependent wet etch of single
crystalline silicon in potassium hydroxide (KOH) allows a range of shapes
formed and has significant impacts on MEMS (microelectromechanical systems),
AFM (atomic force microscopy), and microfluidics. Here, a crystal direction
dependent dry etching principle in an inductively-coupled plasma reactive ion
etcher is presented, which allows to selectively reveal desired crystal planes
in monocrystalline diamond by controlling the etching conditions. The principle
is demonstrated when the kinetic energy of incident ions on diamond surfaces is
reduced below a certain threshold leading to anisotropic etching and faceting
along specific crystal planes. Using the principle, monolithic diamond
nanopillars for magnetometry using nitrogen vacancy centers are fabricated. In
these nanopillars, a half-tapering angle up to 21{\deg} is achieved, the
highest angle reported, which leads to a high photon efficiency and high
mechanical strength of the nanopillar. These results represent the first
demonstration of crystallographic orientation dependent reactive ion etch
principle, which opens a new window for shaping specific nanostructures which
is at the heart of nanotechnology. It is believed that this principle will
prove to be valuable for structuring and patterning of other single crystal
materials as well.

way, the evolution law of the electric field $E^\alpha = Ee^\alpha\ (e^\alpha
e_\alpha=1)$, relative to an arbitrary set of instantaneous observers along a
null geodesic ray, for an arbitrary Lorentzian spacetime, in the geometrical
optics limit of Maxwell's equations in vacuum. We show that, in general,
neither the magnitude $E$ nor the direction $e^\alpha$ of the electric field
(here interpreted as the observed polarization of light) are parallel
transported along the ray. For an extended reference frame around the given
light ray, we express the evolution of the direction $e^\alpha$ in terms of the
frame's kinematics, proving thereby that its expansion never spoils parallel
transport, which bears on the unbiased inference of intrinsic properties of
cosmological sources, such as, for instance, the polarization field of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). As an application of the newly derived laws,
we consider a simple setup for a gravitational wave (GW) interferometer,
showing that, despite the (kinematic) shear induced by the GW, the change in
the final interference pattern is negligible since it turns out to be of the
order of the ratio of the GW and laser frequencies.

2004.03509v1,2020-04-07,2020-04-07,Semi-automatic construction of Lattice Boltzmann models,"  A crucial step in constructing a Lattice Boltzmann model is the definition of
a suitable set of lattice velocities, and the correct assignment of the
associated weights. For high-order models, the solution of this problem
requires a non-trivial effort. The paper outlines the functioning of a publicly
available Python script which has been written to assist researchers in that
task. The speed of sound $c_s$ is considered as a parameter, which can, within
limits, be chosen at will. Under this premise, the Maxwell-Boltzmann constraint
equations are a system of linear equations to determine the weights, and hence
amenable to numerical solution by standard linear algebra library routines. By
suitable contractions, the tensor equations are mapped to a set of equivalent
scalar equations, which simplifies the treatment significantly. For a
user-supplied set of velocity shells, the software first checks if a solution
for the weights exists, and returns it if it also happens to be unique. In such
a case, the software also calculates the range of $c_s$ values that yield
positive weights. Standard models like D3Q19 with a well-defined special $c_s$
value then result as limiting cases where one of the weights vanishes. In case
of an infinite set of solutions, the user may find one particular solution by
supplying a $c_s$ value, and then minimizing one or several weights within the
framework of standard linear programming. Some examples illustrate the
feasibility and usefulness of the approach. A number of models that have been
discussed in the literature are nicely reproduced, while the software has also
been able to find some new models of even higher order.

  substitution and impurity phases in Fe1-xVxSe","  We have performed transverse- and zero-field muon spin rotation/relaxation
experiments, as well as magnetometry measurements, on samples of Fe1-xVxSe and
their Li+NH3 intercalates Li0.6(NH2)0.2(NH3)0.8 Fe1-x Vx Se. We examine the low
vanadium substitution regime: x = 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02. The intercalation
reaction significantly increases the critical temperature (Tc) and the
superfluid stiffness for all x. The nonintercalated samples all exhibit Tc =
8.5 K while the intercalated samples all show an enhanced Tc > 40 K. Vanadium
substitution has a negligible effect on Tc, but seems to suppress the
superfluid stiffness for the nonintercalated samples and weakly enhance it for
the intercalated materials. The optimal substitution level for the intercalated
samples is found to be x = 0.01, with Tc = 41 K and {\lambda}_{ab}(0) = 0.18
{\mu}m. The nonintercalated samples can be modeled with either a single d-wave
superconducting gap or with an anisotropic gap function based on recent
quasiparticle imaging experiments, whereas the intercalates display multigap
nodal behavior which can be fitted using s + d- or d + d-wave models.
Magnetism, likely from iron impurities, appears after the intercalation
reaction and coexists and competes with the superconductivity. However, it
appears that the superconductivity is remarkably robust to the impurity phase,
providing an avenue to stably improve the superconducting properties of
transition metal substituted FeSe.

boiling point of the SrCl2 solvent. This leads to non-equilibrium growth
conditions and dramatically shortens the lifetime of expensive Pt crucibles.
Here, we report the growth of Sr2IrO4, Sr3Ir2O7 and SrIrO3 single crystals in a

show that the yield of the different phases strongly depends on the
nutrient/solvent ratio for fixed soak temperature and cooling rate. Using this
low-temperature growth approach generally leads to a lower
temperature-independent contribution to the magnetic susceptibility than
previously reported. Crystals of SrIrO3 exhibit a paramagnetic behavior that
can be remarkably well fitted with a Curie-Weiss law yielding physically
reasonable parameters, in contrast to previous reports. Hence, reducing the
soak temperature below the solvent boiling point not only provides more stable
and controllable growth conditions in contrast to previously reported growth
protocols, but also extends considerably the lifetime of expensive platinum
crucibles and reduces the corrosion of heating and thermoelements of standard
furnaces, thereby reducing growth costs.

  line","  Magnetic fields in turbulent, convective high-$\beta$ plasma naturally
develop highly tangled and complex topologies---the solar photosphere being the
paradigmatic example. These fields are mostly undetectable by standard
diagnostic techniques with finite spatio-temporal resolution due to
cancellations of Zeeman polarization signals. Observations of resonance
scattering polarization have been considered to overcome these problems. But up
to now, observations of scattering polarization lack the necessary combination
of high sensitivity and high spatial resolution in order to directly infer the
turbulent magnetic structure at the resolution limit of solar telescopes. Here,
we report the detection of clear spatial structuring of scattering polarization
in a magnetically quiet solar region at disk center in the Sr~{\sc i}
4607~\AA~spectral line on granular scales, confirming theoretical expectations.
We find that the linear polarization presents a strong spatial correlation with
the local quadrupole of the radiation field. The result indicates that
polarization survives the dynamic and turbulent magnetic environment of the
middle photosphere and is thereby usable for spatially resolved Hanle
observations. This is an important step toward the long-sought goal of directly
observing turbulent solar magnetic fields at the resolution limit and
investigating their spatial structure.

stellar objects can be used to probe the magnetic field, radiation anisotropy,
or drift between dust and gas, depending on whether the non-spherical grains
are aligned magnetically, radiatively or mechanically. We show that it can also
be used to probe another key disk property -- the temperature gradient -- along
sight lines that are optically thick, independent of the grain alignment
mechanism. We first illustrate the technique analytically using a simple 1D
slab model, which yields an approximate formula that relates the polarization
fraction to the temperature gradient with respect to the optical depth tau at
the tau=1 surface. The formula is then validated using models of stellar
irradiated disks with and without accretion heating. The promises and
challenges of the technique are illustrated with a number of Class 0 and I
disks with ALMA dust polarization data, including NGC 1333 IRAS4A1, IRAS
16293B, BHB 07-11, L1527, HH 212 and HH 111. We find, in particular, that the
sight lines passing through the near-side of a highly inclined disk trace
different temperature gradient directions than those through the far-side,
which can lead to a polarization orientation on the near-side that is
orthogonal to that on the far-side, and that the HH 111 disk may be such a
case. Our technique for probing the disk temperature gradient through dust
polarization can complement other methods, particularly those using molecular
lines.

  cycles","  Results. The PCA confirms the existence of the Gnevyshev gap (GG) for solar
cycles at about 40% from the start of the cycle. The temporal evolution of
sunspot area data for even cycles shows that the GG exists at least at the 95%
confidence level for all sizes of sunspots. On the other hand, the GG is
shorter and statistically insignificant for the odd cycles of aerial sunspot
data. Furthermore, the analysis of sunspot area sizes for even and odd cycles
of SC12-SC23 shows that the greatest difference is at 4.2-4.6 years, where even
cycles have a far smaller total area than odd cycles. The average area of the
individual sunspots of even cycles is also smaller in this interval. The
statistical analysis of the temporal evolution shows that northern sunspot
groups maximise earlier than southern groups for even cycles, but are
concurrent for odd cycles. Furthermore, the temporal distributions of odd
cycles are slightly more leptokurtic than distributions of even cycles. The
skewnesses are 0.37 and 0.49 and the kurtoses 2.79 and 2.94 for even and odd
cycles, respectively. The correlation coefficient between skewness and kurtosis
for even cycles is 0.69, and for odd cycles, it is 0.90. Conclusions. The
separate PCAs for even and odd sunspot cycles show that odd cycles are more
inhomogeneous than even cycles, especially in GSN data. Even cycles, however,
have two anomalous cycles: SC4 and SC6. According to the analysis of the
sunspot area size data, the GG is more distinct in even than odd cycles. We
also present another Waldmeier-type rule, that is, we find a correlation
between skewness and kurtosis of the sunspot group cycles.

carriers with other quantum phenomena. Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$ has been
proposed to be a magnetic Weyl semimetal and provides an excellent platform to
study the coupling between Weyl fermions and magnons. Here, we report
comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on single
crystals of Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$, which have been well characterized by
magnetization and magnetotransport measurements, both of which demonstrate that
the material is a topologically nontrivial semimetal. The INS spectra clearly
show a spin gap of $\sim6$ meV. The dispersion in the magnetic Mn layer extends
up to about 76 meV, while that between the layers has a narrow band width of 6
meV. We find that the linear spin-wave theory using a Heisenberg spin
Hamiltonian can reproduce the experimental spectra with the following
parameters: a nearest-neighbor ($SJ_1\sim28.0$ meV) and next-nearest-neighbor
in-plane exchange interaction ($SJ_2\sim9.3$ meV) , interlayer exchange
coupling ($SJ_c\sim-0.1$ meV), and spin anisotropy constant ($SD\sim-0.07$
meV). Despite the coexistence of Weyl fermions and magnons, we find no clear
evidence that the magnetic dynamics are influenced by the Weyl fermions in
Sr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1-y}$Sb$_2$, possibly because that the Weyl fermions and magnons
reside in the Sb and Mn layers separately, and the interlayer coupling is weak
due to the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the material, as also evident from
the small $SJ_c$ of -0.1 meV.

Clustering is a technique that organises search-result content into coherent

a confidence measure for discarding inconsistent clusters improves the quality

proposals for the allocation of resources is a foundation of modern science. A
very common method is that proposals are evaluated by a small panel of experts
(due to logistics and funding limitations) nominated by the grant-giving
institutions. The expert panel process introduces several issues - most
notably: 1) biases introduced in the selection of the panel. 2) experts have to
read a very large number of proposals. Distributed Peer Review promises to
alleviate several of the described problems by distributing the task of
reviewing among the proposers. Each proposer is given a limited number of
proposals to review and rank. We present the result of an experiment running a
machine-learning enhanced distributed peer review process for allocation of
telescope time at the European Southern Observatory. In this work, we show that
the distributed peer review is statistically the same as a `traditional' panel,
that our machine learning algorithm can predict expertise of reviewers with a
high success rate, and we find that seniority and reviewer expertise have an
influence on review quality. The general experience has been overwhelmingly
praised from the participating community (using an anonymous feedback
mechanism).

However, a single resilience manager, placed at the centre of the system to

normalisations for improving the discriminative power of features. Besides, we
provide a stable solution for training the eigenvalue-decomposition function

2004.04859v1,2020-04-09,2020-04-09,Thin film growth models with long surface diffusion lengths,"  In limited mobility (LM) models of thin film deposition, the final position
of each atom or molecule is chosen according to a set of stochastic rules
before the incidence of another atom or molecule. Here we investigate the
possibility of a LM model to reproduce features of a more realistic approach
that represents the interplay of collective adatom diffusion and the external
flux. In the LM model introduced here, each adatom may execute $G$ hops to
neighboring columns of the deposit, but a hop attempt from a site with $n$
lateral neighbors has probability $P^n$, with $P<1$. These rules resemble those
of the Clarke-Vvedensky (CV) model without energy barriers at step edges, whose
main parameters are the diffusion-to-deposition ratio $R$ on terraces and the
detachment probability $\epsilon$ per lateral neighbor. At short times, the
roughness of the LM model can be written in terms of a scaling function of $G$
and $P$ and the growth exponent is consistent with the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma
universality class. The evolution of the surface roughness and of the
autocorrelation function of the CV model is reproduced with reasonable accuracy
by the LM model with suitable choices of parameters. The increase of the
parameters $G$ and $R$ of those models produces smoother film surfaces, while
the increase of $P$ and $\epsilon$ smoothen the terrace boundaries at short
lengthscales. However, the detachment probabilities of the two models have very
different effects on the surface roughness: in the LM model, for fixed $G$, the
surface roughness increases as $P$ increases; in the CV model, the surface
smoothens as $\epsilon$ increases, for fixed $R$. This result is related to the
non-Markovian nature of the LM model, since the diffusivity of an adatom
depends on its history at the film surface and may be severely reduced after a
detachment from a terrace step.

  interaction model","  Purpose: A reliable model to simulate nuclear interactions is fundamental for
Ion-therapy. We already showed how BLOB (""Boltzmann-Langevin One Body""), a
model developed to simulate heavy ion interactions up to few hundreds of MeV/u,
could simulate also $^{12}$C reactions in the same energy domain. However, its
computation time is too long for any medical application. For this reason we
present the possibility of emulating it with a Deep Learning algorithm.
Methods: The BLOB final state is a Probability Density Function (PDF) of
finding a nucleon in a position of the phase space. We discretised this PDF and
trained a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to reproduce such a discrete PDF. As a
proof of concept, we developed and trained a VAE to emulate BLOB in simulating
the interactions of $^{12}$C with $^{12}$C at 62 MeV/u. To have more control on
the generation, we forced the VAE latent space to be organised with respect to
the impact parameter ($b$) training a classifier of $b$ jointly with the VAE.
Results: The distributions obtained from the VAE are similar to the input ones
and the computation time needed to use the VAE as a generator is negligible.
Conclusions: We show that it is possible to use a Deep Learning approach to
emulate a model developed to simulate nuclear reactions in the energy range of
interest for Ion-therapy. We foresee the implementation of the generation part
in C++ and to interface it with the most used Monte Carlo toolkit: Geant4.

  Contrast Agents","  Acoustic characterization of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs, coated
microbubbles) relies on the attenuation theory that assumes the UCAs oscillate
linearly at sufficiently low excitation pressures. Effective shell parameters
of the UCAs can be estimated by fitting a theoretical attenuation curve to
experimentally measured attenuation data. Depending on the excitation frequency
and properties of the shell, however, an UCA may oscillate nonlinearly even at
sufficiently low excitation pressures violating the assumption in the linear
attenuation theory. Notably, the concern on the estimation of the attenuation
coefficient of a microbubble at resonance using linearized approximation has
long been addressed. In this article, we investigated the attenuation
phenomenon through analyzing the energy dissipation of a single UCA and
propagating waves in an UCA suspension, both of which employed a nonlinear
Rayleigh-Plesset equation. Analytical formulae capable of estimating the
attenuation coefficient due to the weakly nonlinear oscillations of the UCA
were obtained with a relatively rigorous mathematical analysis. The computed
results that were verified by numerical simulations showed the attenuation
coefficient of the UCA at resonance was pressure-dependent and could be
significantly smaller than that predicted by the linear attenuation theory.
Polydispersity of the UCA population enlarged the difference in the estimation
of attenuation between the linear and present second-order nonlinear theories.

showing that pressures tend to stabilize the skyrmion states and at higher
temperatures. The observations also indicate that the skyrmion state can be
achieved at higher temperatures in various crystal symmetries, suggesting the
insensitivity of skyrmions to the underlying crystal lattices and thus the
possible more ubiquitous presence of skyrmions in helimagnets.

be fully realized in the universe. Here, we focus on the astronomical scales
ruled by gravity, where scale symmetry holds and gives rise to a truly scale
invariant distribution of matter, namely it gives rise to a fractal geometry. A
suitable explanation of the features of the fractal cosmic mass distribution is
provided by the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann--Emden equation. An alternative
interpretation of this equation is connected with theories of quantum gravity.
We study the fractal solutions of the equation and connect them with the
statistical theory of random multiplicative cascades, which originated in the
theory of fluid turbulence. The type of multifractal mass distributions so
obtained agrees with results from the analysis of cosmological simulations and
of observations of the galaxy distribution.

floor plans using the concept of Bayesian Surprise. Taking into account that a
person's expectation is an important aspect of the perception of space, we
exploit the theory of Bayesian Surprise to robustly model expectation and thus
surprise in the context of building structures. We use Isovist Analysis, which
is a popular space syntax technique, to turn qualitative object attributes into
quantitative environmental information. Since isovists are location-specific
patterns of visibility, a sequence of isovists describes the spatial perception
during a movement along multiple points in space. We then use Bayesian Surprise
in a feature space consisting of these isovist readings. To demonstrate the
suitability of our approach, we take ""snapshots"" of an agent's local
environment to provide a short list of images that characterize a traversed
trajectory through a 2D indoor environment. Those fingerprints represent
surprising regions of a tour, characterize the traversed map and enable indoor
LBS to focus more on important regions. Given this idea, we propose to use
""surprise"" as a new dimension of context in indoor location-based services
(LBS). Agents of LBS, such as mobile robots or non-player characters in
computer games, may use the context surprise to focus more on important regions
of a map for a better use or understanding of the floor plan.

some of whose properties are characteristic of topological Dirac or Weyl

magnetoresistance that it exhibits at low temperatures. An important question
is the degree to which this property can be ascribed to a conventional
semi-metallic model in which a highly compensated, high mobility metal exhibits
large magnetoresistance. Here we show that the longitudinal thermopower
(Seebeck effect) of semi-metallic WTe$_2$ exfoliated flakes exhibits periodic
sign changes about zero with increasing magnetic field that indicates distinct
electron and hole Landau levels and nearly fully compensated electron and hole
carrier densities. However, inconsistent with a conventional semi-metallic
picture, we find a rapid enhancement of the Nernst effect at low temperatures
that is nonlinear in magnetic field, which is consistent with Weyl points in
proximity to the Fermi energy. Hence, we demonstrate the role played by the
Weyl character of WTe$_2$ in its transport properties.

in the context of medical imaging due to its adaptability and robustness in 3D
object modeling. A field that utilizes BSI is Image Guided Surgery (IGS). IGS
provides navigation using medical images, which can be segmented and
reconstructed into 3D models, often through BSI. Image registration tasks also
use BSI to align pre-operative data to intra-operative data. However, such IGS
tasks are computationally demanding, especially when applied to 3D medical
images, due to the complexity and amount of data involved. Therefore,
optimization of IGS algorithms is greatly desirable, for example, to perform
image registration tasks intra-operatively and to enable real-time
applications. A traditional CPU does not have sufficient computing power to
achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel GPU implementation of
BSI to accelerate the calculation of the deformation field in non-rigid image
registration algorithms.
  Methods. Our BSI implementation on GPUs minimizes the data that needs to be
moved between memory and processing cores during loading of the input grid, and
leverages the large on-chip GPU register file for reuse of input values.
Moreover, we re-formulate our method as trilinear interpolations to reduce
computational complexity and increase accuracy. To provide pre-clinical
validation of our method and demonstrate its benefits in medical applications,
we integrate our improved BSI into a registration workflow for compensation of
liver deformation (caused by pneumoperitoneum, i.e., inflation of the abdomen)
and evaluate its performance.
  Results. Our approach improves the performance of BSI by an average of 6.5x
and interpolation accuracy by 2x compared to three state-of-the-art GPU
implementations. We observe up to 34% acceleration of non-rigid image
registration.

planes of oriented crystals is accompanied by incoherent scattering by atomic
cores. While the coherent particle deflection, described by the axial or planar
averaged potential, becomes more and more classical at high energies, the
incoherent scattering of relativistic particles remains essentially quantum.
Though the latter reminds the scattering by atoms of amorphous medium at high
enough momentum transfers, at the smallest ones the incoherent scattering
process in crystals experiences some modification by the influence of the
inhomogeneity of the atom distribution in the plane, normal to the crystal axis
or plane. Considering the axial case as a more general example, we present a
consistent theory of high energy particles incoherent scattering in oriented
crystals. The latter takes into consideration both the quantum scattering
nature and the atom distribution inhomogeneity, revealing the limited
applicability of the scattering cross section notion. The way to incorporate
the quantum scattering features into the widely used classical trajectory
simulations is elaborated using newly introduced mean square scattering angle

topology of the order parameter, topology of the Fermi surface, the spectrum of
bulk and edge Fermionic excitations, and the structure of the impurity
potential. In the case of electronic heat transport, impurities induce an
anomalous (zero-field) thermal Hall conductivity that is easily orders of
magnitude larger than the quantized edge contribution. The effect originates
from branch-conversion scattering of Bogoliubov quasiparticles by the chiral
order parameter, induced by potential scattering. The former transfers angular
momentum between the condensate and the excitations that transport heat. The
anomalous thermal Hall conductivity is shown to depend to the structure of the
electron-impurity potential, as well as the winding number, $\nu$, of the
chiral order parameter, $\Delta(p)=|\Delta(p)|\,e^{i\nu\phi_{p}}$. The results
provide quantitative formulae for interpreting heat transport experiments

individuals that are characterized by different diffusion coefficients but are
otherwise identical, is investigated. Competition is taken into account through

observed that the mean value and the relative width of the initial distribution
of the diffusion coefficients characterizing the individuals together with the
temporal fluctuations determine the final distribution of the diffusivities
(diffusion coefficients leading to the competition success) as well as the
final diversity of the system at finite time (the number of different diffusion
coefficients present in the system). Large initial mean diffusivity of the
system leads to a rather fast disappearance of the diversity. Instead, small
initial mean diffusivity of the system leads to a diversity equal to the number
of niches forming in the system due to the competitive interactions. The
cluster formation is also associated to the competition success of the slower
diffusing individuals. The diversity is diminished by the increase of the
temporal fluctuations that give the competition advantage to the faster
diffusing individuals. Somewhat counterintuitively, under certain conditions
the competition success is given by intermediate values of the diffusion
coefficients.

combination of inverse kinematics at low energy and the use of the VAMOS++

play a significant role in the nucleation of new ice particles has been debated
for several decades. While the early works of Fukuta and Lee (1986) and Baker
(1991) indicated that it might be irrelevant, the more recent study of
Prabhakaran et al. (2019) [arXiv:1906.06129] suggested otherwise. In this work,
we are aiming to quantify the ice-nucleating potential using high-fidelity flow
simulation techniques around a single hydrometeor and use favorable
considerations to upscale the effects to a collective of ice particles in
clouds. While we find that ice nucleation may be enhanced in the vicinity of a
warm hydrometeor by several orders of magnitude and that the affected volume of
air is much larger than previously estimated, it is very unlikely that this
effect alone causes the rapid enhancement of ice nucleation observed in some
types of clouds, mainly due to the low initial volumetric ice concentration.
Nonetheless, it is suggested to implement this effect into existing cloud
models in order to investigate second-order effects such as ice nucleus
preactivation or enhancement after the onset of glaciation.

additional challenge compared to calculations of large molecules. We mention
technical aspects of computer code implementations of periodic coupled cluster

the projector-augmented-wave formalism using a plane wave basis set and the

2004.06470v1,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,Habitability is a continuous property of nature,"  In their recent comment, Cockell et al. argue that the habitability of an
environment is fundamentally a binary property; that is to say, an environment
can either support the metabolic processes of a given organism or not. The
habitability of different environments, they argue, may have different degrees
that could be determined at least in theory by answering the question: 'is this
environment habitable to a given organism?' 'More' or 'less' habitable
environments could then be related by the number of yes or no answers given to
what is fundamentally a series of binary questions and decisions. In my
opinion, there are at least three implicit assumptions made for this line of
reasoning that are implausible and that sabotage the conclusions. The first is
in the genetic diversity of the organisms, which I argue is fundamentally
continuous in nature and a binary construction of the sample is not meaningful.
The second misconception is in the assumption that an ecosystem can be
decomposed into subsets of independent samples. The third problem is in the
definition of an environment. The question of the environment is a continuous
one in both space and time and thus any concept constructed to be applicable to
a sample of environments must be continuous as well. In summary, the question
of whether habitability is a binary quantity or not brings us back to the
question of whether our concepts of life and of the environments that life
thrives in (or not) are binary or non-binary. I argue that the latter is the
case, and hence any modern concept of habitability must be continuous too.

the crystalline monolayer directly on the toluene-water interface and a thick

the condensation of nonionogenic surfactant micelles for which the surface

  Method: We followed a 3-stage approach in our research. First, we conducted a

groups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in
total) and conducted a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest
downloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30 participants.
  Results: We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature
from heuristic inspection. The most (21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and
minimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale (SUS)
scores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the
heuristic evaluation. Thus, the results of heuristic evaluation and user

entails thermally activated processes, which are most likely due to skyrmion

supported by our numerical simulations considering boundary effects, which
reveals that the edges limit the steady flow of skyrmions, especially at low

hypertensives, and participants with previous heart attack. Typical processing
time was ~260 frames (~13 slices) per second on an NVIDIA Tesla K40 with 12GB

The fully automated RNNCNN framework for analysis of myocardial strain enabled
unbiased strain evaluation in a high-throughput workflow, with similar ability
to distinguish impairment due to diabetes, hypertension, and previous heart

via the vapor liquid solid method. Apart from serving as a collections center
for growth species, the gold droplets carry an additional crucial role that
necessarily precedes the nanowire emergence, that is, they assist the
nucleation of nanocraters with strongly faceted 111B side walls. Only once
these facets become sufficiently large and regular, the gold droplets start
nucleating and guiding the growth of nanowires. We show that this dual role of
the gold droplets can be detected and monitored by high energy electron
diffraction during growth. Moreover, gold induced formation of craters and the
onset of nanowires growth on the 111B facets inside the craters are confirmed
by the results of Monte Carlo simulations. The detailed insight into the growth
mechanism of inclined nanowires will help to engineer new and complex nanowire
based device architectures.

2004.08211v1,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,Accelerating Universe in Hybrid and Logarithmic Teleparallel Gravity,"  Teleparallel gravity is a modified theory of gravity for which the Ricci
scalar $R$ of the underlying geometry in the action is replaced by an arbitrary
functional form of torsion scalar $T$. In doing so, cosmology in $% f(T)$
gravity becomes greatly simplified owing to the fact that $T$ contains only the
first derivatives of the vierbeins. The article exploits this appealing nature
of $f(T)$ gravity and present cosmological scenarios from hybrid and
logarithmic teleparallel gravity models of the form $% f=e^{mT}T^n $ and
$f=D\log(bT)$ respectively, where $m$, $n$, $D$ and $b$ are free parameters
constrained to suffice the late time acceleration. We employ a well motivated
parametrization of the deceleration parameter having just one degree of freedom
constrained with a $\chi^{2}$ test from 57 data points of Hubble data set in
the redshift range $0.07<z<2.36$, to obtain the expressions of pressure,
density and EoS parameter for both the teleparallel gravity models and study
their temporal evolution. We find the deceleration parameter to experience a
signature flipping for the $\chi^{2}$ value of the free parameter at
$z_{tr}\simeq0.6$ which is consistent with latest Planck measurements. Next, we
present few geometric diagnostics of this parametrization to understand the
nature of dark energy and its deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Finally, we study the energy conditions to check the consistency of the
parameter spaces for both the teleparallel gravity models. We find the SEC to
violate for both the models which is an essential recipe to obtain an
accelerating universe.

reduce the hysteresis further, but shifts the martensitic transition close to

In this work, we address the problem of Simultaneous Cooperative

assumption of no data association uncertainty or employ a hard-decision rule

SCS-MTT method for an unknown and time-varying number of targets under
association uncertainty. Marginal posterior densities for agents and targets
are obtained by an efficient belief propagation (BP) based scheme while data
association is handled by marginalizing over all target-to-measurement
association probabilities. Decentralized single Gaussian and Gaussian mixture
implementations are provided based on average consensus schemes, which require
communication only with one-hop neighbors. An additional novelty is a
decentralized Gibbs mechanism for efficient evaluation of the product of
Gaussian mixtures. Numerical experiments show the improved CS and MTT
performance compared to the conventional approach of separate localization and
target tracking.

formalism (FTP) and renormalization theory (RT). The potential conflict of FTP
and RT is investigated in $g \phi^3$ QFT, by using the retarded/advanced
($R/A$) basis of Green functions and dimensional renormalization (DR). For
example, vertices immediately after (in time) divergent self-energy loops do
not conserve energy, as integrals diverge. We ""repair"" them, while keeping
$d<4$, to obtain energy conservation at those vertices. Already in the S-matrix
theory, the renormalized, finite part of Feynman self-energy $\Sigma_{F}(p_0)$
does not vanish when $|p_0|\rightarrow\infty$ and cannot be split to retarded
and advanced parts. In the Glaser--Epstein approach, the causality is repaired
in the composite object $G_F(p_0)\Sigma_{F}(p_0)$. In the FTP approach, after
repairing the vertices, the corresponding composite objects are
$G_R(p_0)\Sigma_{R}(p_0)$ and $\Sigma_{A}(p_0)G_A(p_0)$. In the limit
$d\rightarrow 4$, one obtains causal QFT. The tadpole contribution splits into
diverging and finite parts. The diverging, constant component is eliminated by
the renormalization condition $\langle 0|\phi|0\rangle =0$ of the S-matrix
theory. The finite, oscillating energy-nonconserving tadpole contributions
vanish in the limit $t\rightarrow \infty $.

A visible albedo of 10% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were

combination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a
significant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380

for rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important
source of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is

2001.00145v1,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,Local Stability of PD Controlled Bipedal Walking Robots,"  We establish stability results for PD tracking control laws in bipedal
walking robots. Stability of PD control laws for continuous robotic systems is
an established result, and we extend this for hybrid robotic systems, an
alternating sequence of continuous and discrete events. Bipedal robots have the
leg-swing as the continuous event, and the foot-strike as the discrete event.
In addition, bipeds largely have underactuations due to the interactions
between feet and ground. For each continuous event, we establish that the
convergence rate of the tracking error can be regulated via appropriate tuning
of the PD gains; and for each discrete event, we establish that this
convergence rate sufficiently overcomes the nonlinear impacts by assumptions on
the hybrid zero dynamics. The main contributions are 1) Extension of the
stability results of PD control laws for underactuated robotic systems, and 2)
Exponential ultimate boundedness of hybrid periodic orbits under the assumption
of exponential stability of their projections to the hybrid zero dynamics.

  gravity","  In this paper, we consider wormhole geometries in the context of teleparallel
equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) as well as $f(T)$ gravity. The TEGR is
an alternative geometrical formulation of Einstein's general relativity, where
modified teleparallel gravity or $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an
alternative approach for explaining an accelerated expansion of the universe.
We present the analytical solutions under the assumption of spherical symmetry
and the existence of a conformal Killing vectors to proceed a more systematic
approach in searching for exact wormhole solutions. More preciously, the
existence of a conformal symmetry places restrictions on the model. Considering
the field equations with a diagonal tetrad and anisotropic distribution of the
fluid, we study the properties of traversable wormholes in TEGR that violates
the weak and the null energy conditions at the throat and its vicinity. In the
second part, wormhole solutions are constructed in the framework of $f(T)$
gravity, where $T$ represents torsion scalar. As a consistency check, we also
discuss the behavior of energy conditions with a viable power-law $f(T)$ model
and the corresponding shape functions. In addition, a wide variety of solutions
are deduced by considering a linear equation of state relating the density and
pressure, for the isotropic and anisotropic pressure, independently of the
shape functions, and various phantom wormhole geometries are explored.

fit to the updated experimental data of $e^+e^- \to \psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$ and
$e^+e^-\to \Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$. To understand the ""platform"" structure
observed in the range of $4.57 \sim 4.60$ GeV existing in the
$\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ invariant mass spectrum of $e^+e^-\to
\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ of BESIII, we introduce two resonances in this
combined fit to the $e^+e^- \to \psi(2S)\pi^+\pi^-$ and $e^+e^-\to
\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$, which have resonance parameters, $m_{Y_1}=4585\pm2$
MeV, $\Gamma_{Y_1}=29.8\pm8.0$ MeV, $m_{Y_2}=4676\pm7$ MeV, and
$\Gamma_{Y_2}=85.7\pm15.0$ MeV. Furthermore, combining with our theoretical
results, we indicate that the two charmonium-like $Y$ states can be due to two
higher charmonia, which are mixtures of $6S$ and $5D$ $c\bar{c}$ states. Their
two-body open-charm decay behaviors are given. Under the same framework, our

2001.00192v1,2020-01-01,2020-01-01,A Quantized Representation of Probability in the Brain,"  Conventional and current wisdom assumes that the brain represents probability
as a continuous number to many decimal places. This assumption seems
implausible given finite and scarce resources in the brain. Quantization is an
information encoding process whereby a continuous quantity is systematically
divided into a finite number of possible categories. Rounding is a simple
example of quantization. We apply this information theoretic concept to develop
a novel quantized (i.e., discrete) probability distortion function. We develop
three conjunction probability gambling tasks to look for evidence of quantized
probability representations in the brain. We hypothesize that certain ranges of
probability will be lumped together in the same indifferent category if a
quantized representation exists. For example, two distinct probabilities such
as 0.57 and 0.585 may be treated indifferently. Our extensive data analysis has
found strong evidence to support such a quantized representation: 59/76
participants (i.e., 78%) demonstrated a best fit to 4-bit quantized models
instead of continuous models. This observation is the major development and
novelty of the present work. The brain is very likely to be employing a
quantized representation of probability. This discovery demonstrates a major
precision limitation of the brain's representational and decision-making
ability.

  discs?","  Planets form in protoplanetary discs. Their masses, distribution, and orbits
sensitively depend on the structure of the protoplanetary discs. However, what
sets the initial structure of the discs in terms of mass, radius and accretion
rate is still unknown. We perform non-ideal MHD numerical simulations using the
adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses, of a collapsing, one solar mass,
molecular core to study the disc formation and early, up to 100 kyr, evolution,
paying great attention to the impact of numerical resolution and accretion
scheme. We found that while the mass of the central object is almost
independent of the numerical parameters such as the resolution and the
accretion scheme onto the sink particle, the disc mass, and to a lower extent
its size, heavily depend on the accretion scheme, which we found, is itself
resolution dependent. This implies that the accretion onto the star and through
the disc are largely decoupled. For a relatively large domain of initial
conditions (except at low magnetisation), we found that the properties of the
disc do not change too significantly. In particular both the level of initial
rotation and turbulence do not influence the disc properties provide the core
is sufficiently magnetized. After a short relaxation phase, the disc settles in
a stationary state. It then slowly grows in size but not in mass. The disc
itself is weakly magnetized but its immediate surrounding is on the contrary
highly magnetized. Our results show that the disc properties directly depend on
the inner boundary condition, i.e. the accretion scheme onto the central
object, suggesting that the disc mass is eventually controlled by the small
scale accretion process, possibly the star-disc interaction. Because of
ambipolar diffusion and its significant resistivity, the disc diversity remains
limited and except for low magnetisation, their properties are (abridged).

$T_1$ = 310 ms and $T_2$ = 4 $\mu$s, establishing the viability of these qubit
candidates. With increasing temperature, $T_2$ remains constant up to T = 60 K

  Fields","  We address the increase of electron drift velocity that arises in
semiconductor superlattices (SLs) subjected to constant electric and magnetic
fields. It occurs if the magnetic field possesses nonzero components both along
and perpendicular to the SL axis and the Bloch oscillations along the SL axis
become resonant with cyclotron rotation in the transverse plane. It is a
phenomenon of considerable interest, so that it is important to understand the
underlying mechanism. In an earlier Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 166802

occurs through chaotic diffusion along a stochastic web (SW) within
semiclassical collisionless dynamics, the phenomenon actually arises through a
non-chaotic mechanism. In fact, any chaos that occurs tends to reduce the
drift. We now provide fuller details, elucidating the mechanism in physical
terms, and extending the investigation. In particular, we: (i) demonstrate that
pronounced drift enhancement can still occur even in the complete absence of an
SW; (ii) show that, where an SW does exist and its characteristic slow dynamics
comes into play, it suppresses the drift enhancement even before strong chaos
is manifested; (iii) generalize our theory for non-small temperature, showing
that heating does not affect the enhancement mechanism and accounting for some
earlier numerical observations; (iv) demonstrate that certain analytic results

  and Prior Knowledge","  Chemical-disease relation (CDR) extraction is significantly important to
various areas of biomedical research and health care. Nowadays, many
large-scale biomedical knowledge bases (KBs) containing triples about entity
pairs and their relations have been built. KBs are important resources for
biomedical relation extraction. However, previous research pays little
attention to prior knowledge. In addition, the dependency tree contains
important syntactic and semantic information, which helps to improve relation
extraction. So how to effectively use it is also worth studying. In this paper,
we propose a novel convolutional attention network (CAN) for CDR extraction.
Firstly, we extract the shortest dependency path (SDP) between chemical and
disease pairs in a sentence, which includes a sequence of words, dependency
directions, and dependency relation tags. Then the convolution operations are
performed on the SDP to produce deep semantic dependency features. After that,
an attention mechanism is employed to learn the importance/weight of each
semantic dependency vector related to knowledge representations learned from
KBs. Finally, in order to combine dependency information and prior knowledge,
the concatenation of weighted semantic dependency representations and knowledge
representations is fed to the softmax layer for classification. Experiments on
the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that our method achieves comparable
performance with the state-of-the-art systems, and both dependency information
and prior knowledge play important roles in CDR extraction task.

in molecular electronics by serving not only as nanoscale interconnects but
also as active functional elements for nanoelectronic devices. However, because
of the potential volumetric heat generation across such nanojunctions, the
circuit stability becomes often a major concern, which necessitates to study
the heat transport properties at the molecular-scale. Here we report the
thermoelectric behavior of various tr-nuclear metal-string complexes,
$[M-M-M](dpa)_4(NCS)_2$ for $M \in \{Cr,Ru\}$, bridging Au(111) nanowires as
nanoelectrodes. Based on our charge transport analysis from
\textit{first-principles}, we find that the dominant transmission peaks tend to
move away from the Fermi level upon systematic rutheniation in chromium-based
metal-string complexes due mainly to the coupling of $\pi^{*}$ orbitals from Ru
and $\sigma_{nb}$ orbitals from Cr. Such type of a metal-string junction can
also exhibit strong Coulomb interaction so that its thermoelectric behavior
begins to deviate from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results further suggest
that metal-string complexes can render better thermoelectric devices especially
at the molecular-scale with the thermopower as high as 172 $\mu V/K$ at 300 K.

metal-string molecular junctions at room temperature. Resonant enhancement in
the thermoelectric efficiency appears to occur in such systems through
alteration of inter-dot electrostatic interactions, which can be controlled by
incorporating Cr and Ru atoms in such tri-nuclear metal-string complexes.

significant impact on the critical quantities. We also introduce a new ad hoc
pressure related to the perfect fluid dark matter and find a first order van

different values of angular momentum and overtone parameters.

  disc emission of the high-mass YSO IRAS 11101-5829","  Aims: The inner regions of high-mass protostars are often invisible in the
near-infrared. We aim to investigate the inner gaseous disc of IRAS11101-5829
through scattered light from the outflow cavity walls.
  Methods: We observed the environment of the high-mass young stellar object
IRAS11101-5829 and the closest knots of its jet, HH135-136, with the
VLT/SINFONI. We also retrieved archival data from the high-resolution long-slit
spectrograph VLT/X-shooter.
  Results: We detect the first three bandheads of the $\upsilon=2-0$ CO
vibrational emission for the first time in this object. It is coincident with
continuum and Br$\gamma$ emission and extends up to $\sim10000$ au to the
north-east and $\sim10 000$ au to the south-west. The line profiles have been
modelled as a Keplerian rotating disc assuming a single ring in LTE. The model
output gives a temperature of $\sim3000$ K, a CO column density of
$\sim1\times10^{22}\mathrm{ cm^{-2}}$, and a projected Keplerian velocity
$v_\mathrm{K}\sin i_\mathrm{disc} \sim 25\mathrm{ km s^{-1}}$, which is
consistent with previous modelling in other high-mass protostars. In
particular, the low value of $v_\mathrm{K}\sin i_\mathrm{disc}$ suggests that
the disc is observed almost face-on, whereas the well-constrained geometry of
the jet imposes that the disc must be close to edge-on. This apparent
discrepancy is interpreted as the CO seen reflected in the mirror of the
outflow cavity wall.
  Conclusions: From both jet geometry and disc modelling, we conclude that all
the CO emission is seen through reflection by the cavity walls and not
directly. This result implies that in the case of highly embedded objects, as
for many high-mass protostars, line profile modelling alone might be deceptive
and the observed emission could affect the derived physical and geometrical
properties; in particular the inclination of the system can be incorrectly
interpreted.

often chosen in order to attribute physical properties to a particular choice
of coordinates, or otherwise to simplify the form of the resultant equations.
Calculations are then performed with the understanding that they could have
been done in any gauge, and that transformations between different gauges can
be made at will. We show that this logic can be extended to the domain of large
density contrasts, where different types of perturbative expansion are
required, but that the way in which gauges can be chosen in the presence of
such structures is severely constrained. In particular, most gauges that are
commonly considered in the cosmology literature are found to be unviable in the
presence of non-linear structures. This includes spatially flat gauge,
synchronous gauge, comoving orthogonal gauge, total matter gauge, N-body gauge,
and the uniform density gauge. In contrast, we find that the longitudinal gauge
and the Newtonian motion gauge are both viable choices in both standard
cosmological perturbation theory, and in the post-Newtonian perturbative
expansions that are required in order to model non-linear structures.

electrification of the heat supply significantly changes the interaction of the
residential building stock with the grid infrastructure. Evaluating the mass
deployment of DER at the national level would require analyzing millions of
individual buildings, entailing significant computational burden. To overcome
this, this work proposes a novel bottom-up model that consists of an

with a Mixed-Integer Linear Program to derive its cost optimal technology
adoption and operation, determining its changing grid load in future scenarios.
The model is validated for Germany, with 200 typical buildings considered to
sufficiently represent the diversity of the residential building stock. In a
future scenario for 2050, photovoltaic and heat pumps are predicted to be the
most economically and ecologically robust supply solutions for the different
building types. Nevertheless, their electricity generation and demand
temporally do not match, resulting in a doubling of the peak electricity grid
load in the rural areas during the winter. The urban areas can compensate this
with efficient co-generation units, which are not cost-efficient in the rural
areas.

chromospheric He I 10830 A triplet as it helps to constrain the atmospheric
parameters. We study the accuracy of bisector analysis and a line core fit of

network simulation. The profiles are computed solving the radiative transfer
equation, including non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects on the
determination of the atomic level populations of Si I. We found a good
correlation between the inferred velocities from bisectors taken at different
line profile intensities and the original simulation velocity at given optical
depths. This good correlation means that we can associate bisectors taken at
different line-profile percentages with atmospheric layers that linearly
increase as we scan lower spectral line intensities. We also determined that a
fit to the line-core intensity is robust and reliable, providing information
about atmospheric layers that are above those accessible through bisectors.
Therefore, by combining both methods on the Si I 10827 A line, we can
seamlessly trace the quiet-Sun LOS velocity stratification from the deep
photosphere to higher layers until around $\log \tau = -3.5$ in a fast and
straightforward way. This method is ideal for generating quick-look reference

we establish the relationship between the two fully aligned ferromagnetic

The discovery of an evolved galaxy cluster at redshift z=2, corresponding to a
look-back time of 10.4 billion years, provides an opportunity to study its
properties. The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 was originally detected as a faint,
extended X-ray source in the XMM Large Scale Structure survey and was revealed
to be coincident with a compact over-density of galaxies with photometric
redshifts of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Subsequent observations at millimetre wavelengths
detected a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement along the line of sight to XLSSC 122,
thus confirming the existence of hot intracluster gas, while deep imaging
spectroscopy from the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission
(XMM-Newton) revealed an extended, X-ray bright gaseous atmosphere with a
virial temperature of 60 million Kelvin, enriched with metals to the same
extent as are local clusters. Here we report rest frame optical spectroscopic
observations of XLSSC 122 and identify 37 member galaxies at a mean redshift of
1.98, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.4 billion years. We use
photometry to determine a mean, dust-free stellar age of 2.98 billion years,
indicating that star formation commenced in these galaxies at a mean redshift
of 12, when the Universe was only 370 million years old. The full range of
inferred formation redshifts, including the effects of dust, covers the

2001.00563v3,2020-01-02,2020-01-02,Using Data Imputation for Signal Separation in High Contrast Imaging,"  To characterize circumstellar systems in high contrast imaging, the
fundamental step is to construct a best point spread function (PSF) template
for the non-circumstellar signals (i.e., star light and speckles) and separate
it from the observation. With existing PSF construction methods, the
circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably
altered by over-fitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a
necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling--free
solution to these problems with data imputation using sequential non-negative
matrix factorization (DI-sNMF). DI-sNMF first converts this signal separation
problem to a ""missing data"" problem in statistics by flagging the regions which
host circumstellar signals as missing data, then attributes PSF signals to
these regions. We mathematically prove it to have negligible alteration to
circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which
thus enables precise measurement for these circumstellar objects. We apply it
to simulated point source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate
its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) K1-band
observations of the debris disk surrounding HR 4796A, finding a tentative trend
that the dust is more forward scattering as the wavelength increases. We expect
DI-sNMF to be applicable to other general scenarios where the separation of
signals is needed.

strong phase transitions with fast-moving bubble walls, but this effect has
never been quantitatively studied. We rederive fluid equations describing
transport of particle asymmetries near the bubble wall without making the
small-wall-velocity approximation. We show that the suppression of the baryon
asymmetry is a smooth function of the wall speed and that there is no special
behavior when crossing the sound speed barrier. Electroweak baryogenesis can
thus be efficient also with strong detonations, generically associated with
models with observably large gravitational waves. We also make a systematic and
critical comparison of our improved transport equations to another one commonly
used in the literature, based on the VEV-insertion formalism.

  quantum critical metal: a Monte Carlo study","  We present numerically exact results from sign-problem free quantum Monte
Carlo simulations for a spin-fermion model near an $O(3)$ symmetric
antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum critical point. We find a hierarchy of energy
scales that emerges near the quantum critical point. At high energy scales,
there is a broad regime characterized by Landau-damped order parameter dynamics
with dynamical critical exponent $z=2$, while the fermionic excitations remain
coherent. The quantum critical magnetic fluctuations are well described by
Hertz-Millis theory, except for a $T^{-2}$ divergence of the static AFM
susceptibility. This regime persists down to a lower energy scale, where the
fermions become overdamped and concomitantly, a transition into a $d-$wave
superconducting state occurs. These findings resemble earlier results for a
spin-fermion model with easy-plane AFM fluctuations of an $O(2)$ SDW order
parameter, despite noticeable differences in the perturbative structure of the
two theories. In the $O(3)$ case, perturbative corrections to the spin-fermion
vertex are expected to dominate at an additional energy scale, below which the
$z=2$ behavior breaks down, leading to a novel $z=1$ fixed point with emergent
local nesting at the hot spots [Schlief et al., PRX 7, 021010 (2017)].
Motivated by this prediction, we also consider a variant of the model where the
hot spots are nearly locally nested. Within the available temperature range in
our study ($T\ge E_F/200$), we find substantial deviations from the $z=2$
Hertz-Millis behavior, but no evidence for the predicted $z=1$ criticality.

target lower latitudes and incorporating deep optical data from DECam in the
southern Galactic plane, we have derived a catalog of distances to molecular
clouds in Reipurth (2008, Star Formation Handbook, vols I and II) which
contains a large fraction of the molecular material in the solar neighborhood.
Comparison with distances derived from maser parallax measurements towards the
same clouds shows our method produces consistent distances with $\lesssim10\%$

hope this catalog of homogeneous distances will serve as a baseline for future
work.

dual to two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFTs). In this paper, we
extend the holography to the case of an asymptotically anti--de Sitter (AdS)
rotating charged black holes in $f$($T$) gravity, where $f(T) = T + \alpha

symmetries. We note that the $2\pi$ identification of the azimuthal angle
$\phi$ in the black hole line element, corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of
the conformal symmetry by left and right temperatures $T_{L}$ and $T_{R}$,
respectively. We show that choosing proper central charges for the dual CFT, we
produce exactly the macroscopic Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from the microscopic
Cardy entropy for the dual CFT. These observations suggest that the rotating
charged AdS black hole in $f$($T$) gravity is dual to a 2D CFT at finite

  1502+106","  A comprehensive study of multifrequency correlations can shed light on the
nature of variation for blazars. In this work, we collect the long-term radio,
optical and $\gamma$-ray light curves of PKS 1502+106. After performing the
localized cross-correlation function analysis, we find that correlations
between radio and $\gamma$-ray or $V$ band are beyond the $3\sigma$
significance level. The lag of the $\gamma$-ray relative to 15 GHz is
$-60^{+5}_{-10}$ days, translating to a distance $3.18^{+0.50}_{-0.27}$ parsec
(pc) between them. Within uncertainties, the locations of the $\gamma$-ray and
optical emitting regions are roughly the same, and are away from the jet base
within $1.2$ pc. The derived magnetic field in optical and $\gamma$-ray
emitting regions is about $0.36$ G. The logarithm of $\gamma$-ray flux is
significantly linearly correlated with that of $V$ band fluxes, which can be
explained by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process, the external Compton
(EC) processes, or the combination of them. We find a significant linear
correlation in the plot of $\log\prod$ (polarization degree) versus $\log \nu
F_{\nu}$ at $V$ band, and use the empirical relation $\Pi \sim \sin^n \theta'$
($\theta'$ is the observing angle in the comoving frame blob) to explain it.
The behaviors of color index (generally redder when brighter at the active
state) and $\gamma$-ray spectral index (softer when brighter) could be well
explained by the twisted jet model. These findings suggest that the curvature
effect (mainly due to the change of the viewing angle) is dominant in the
variation phenomena of fluxes, spectral indices, and polarization degrees for
PKS 1502+106.

about its formation and evolution processes. Previous studies considered the
Doppler effect on the phase of GWs as a potential signature of a time-dependent
velocity of the source. However, the Doppler shift only accounts for the time
component of the wave vector, and in principle motion also affects the spatial
components. The latter effect, known as ``aberration'' for light, is analyzed
in this paper for GWs and applied to the waveform modeling of an accelerating
source. We show that the additional aberrational phase shift could be
detectable in two astrophysical scenarios, namely, a recoiling binary black
hole (BBH) due to GW radiation and a BBH in a triple system. Our results
suggest that adding the aberrational phase shift in the waveform templates
could significantly enhance the detectability of moving sources.

Cohen-Tannoudji] to study the average rate of change of energy of two identical
two-level atoms interacting with the vacuum massless scalar field in
synchronized motion along stationary trajectories. By separating the
contributions of vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction, we first
show that for the two-atom system initially prepared in the factorizable
eigenstates $|g_Ag_B\rangle$ and $|e_Ae_B\rangle$, where $g$ and $e$ represent
the ground state and the excited state of a single atom respectively, both
vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction contribute to the average
rate of change of energy of the two-atom system, and the contribution of vacuum
fluctuations is independent of the interatomic separation while that of atomic
radiation reaction is dependent on it. This is contrary to the existing results
in the literature where vacuum fluctuations are interatomic-separation
dependent. However, if the two-atom system is initially prepared in the
unfactorizable symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, the average rate of
change of energy of the two-atom system is never perturbed by the vacuum
fluctuations, but is totally a result of the atomic radiation reaction. We then
consider two special cases of motion of the two-atom system which is initially
prepared in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, i.e., synchronized
inertial motion and synchronized uniform acceleration. In contrast to the
average rate of change of energy of a single uniformly accelerated atom, the
average rate of change of energy of the uniformly accelerated two-atom system
is nonthermal-like. The effects of noninertial motion on the transitions of
states of the two correlated atoms are also discussed.

states oscillating by free evolution with frequency determined by the

can induce oscillations of the generated entangled states, with frequency of
the order of the Rabi frequency of the field. For a certain detuning, a

Referring to these states by their mass, the mass values are \begin{align*}
m(\Omega_b(6316)^-) &= 6315.64\pm0.31\pm0.07\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6330)^-) &= 6330.30\pm0.28\pm0.07\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6340)^-) &= 6339.71\pm0.26\pm0.05\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6350)^-) &= 6349.88\pm0.35\pm0.05\pm0.50 {\rm MeV},
\end{align*}where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and the last is
due to the knowledge of the $\Xi_b^0$ mass. The natural widths of the three
lower mass states are consistent with zero, and the 90% confidence-level upper
limits are determined to be ${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6316)^-)<2.8}$ MeV,
${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6330)^-)<3.1}$ MeV and ${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6340)^-)<1.5}$ MeV.
The natural width of the $\Omega_b(6350)^-$ peak is $1.4^{+1.0}_{-0.8}\pm0.1$
MeV, which is 2.5$\sigma$ from zero and corresponds to an upper limit of 2.8
MeV. The peaks have local significances ranging from 3.6$\sigma$ to
7.2$\sigma$. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the significances
of the $\Omega_b(6316)^-$ and $\Omega_b(6330)^-$ peaks are reduced to
2.1$\sigma$ and 2.6$\sigma$ respectively, while the two higher mass peaks
exceed 5$\sigma$. The observed peaks are consistent with expectations for
excited $\Omega_b^-$ resonances.

  in Solving 0-1 Min-max Regret Optimization Problems with Interval Costs","  This paper addresses a class of problems under interval data uncertainty
composed of min-max regret versions of classical 0-1 optimization problems with
interval costs. We refer to them as interval 0-1 min-max regret problems. The
state-of-the-art exact algorithms for this class of problems work by solving a
corresponding mixed integer linear programming formulation in a Benders'
decomposition fashion. Each of the possibly exponentially many Benders' cuts is
separated on the fly through the resolution of an instance of the classical 0-1
optimization problem counterpart. Since these separation subproblems may be
NP-hard, not all of them can be modeled by means of linear programming, unless
P = NP. In these cases, the convergence of the aforementioned algorithms are
not guaranteed in a straightforward manner. In fact, to the best of our
knowledge, their finite convergence has not been explicitly proved for any
interval 0-1 min-max regret problem. In this work, we formally describe these
algorithms through the definition of a logic-based Benders' decomposition
framework and prove their convergence to an optimal solution in a finite number
of iterations. As this framework is applicable to any interval 0-1 min-max
regret problem, its finite optimal convergence also holds in the cases where
the separation subproblems are NP-hard.

2001.01588v1,2020-01-03,2020-01-03,Information Extraction based on Named Entity for Tourism Corpus,"  Tourism information is scattered around nowadays. To search for the
information, it is usually time consuming to browse through the results from
search engine, select and view the details of each accommodation. In this
paper, we present a methodology to extract particular information from full
text returned from the search engine to facilitate the users. Then, the users
can specifically look to the desired relevant information. The approach can be
used for the same task in other domains. The main steps are 1) building
training data and 2) building recognition model. First, the tourism data is
gathered and the vocabularies are built. The raw corpus is used to train for
creating vocabulary embedding. Also, it is used for creating annotated data.
The process of creating named entity annotation is presented. Then, the
recognition model of a given entity type can be built. From the experiments,
given hotel description, the model can extract the desired entity,i.e, name,
location, facility. The extracted data can further be stored as a structured
information, e.g., in the ontology format, for future querying and inference.
The model for automatic named entity identification, based on machine learning,
yields the error ranging 8%-25%.

$\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$ amplitude from the standpoint of the low-energy
theorem $F^{\pi}=e f_\pi^2 F^{3\pi}$, which relates the electromagnetic form
factor $F_{\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma}=F^\pi$ with the form factor
$F_{\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^0\pi^-}=F^{3\pi}$ both taken at vanishing momenta of
mesons. Our approach is based on a recently proposed covariant diagonalization
of $\pi a_1$-mixing within a standard effective QCD-inspired meson Lagrangian
obtained in the framework of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the two
surface terms appearing in the calculation of the anomalous triangle quark
diagrams or AVV- and AAA-type amplitudes are uniquely fixed by this theorem. As
a result, both form factors $F^\pi$ and $F^{3\pi}$ are not affected by the $\pi
a_1$-mixing, but the concept of vector meson dominance (VMD) fails for
$\gamma\to\pi^+\pi^0\pi^-$.

2001.00902v1,2020-01-03,2020-01-03,On phase asymmetries in oscillatory pipe flow,"  We present results from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of oscillatory
pipe flow at several dimensionless frequencies Wo = {6.5, 13, 26} and one fixed
shear Reynolds number Re_{\tau} = 1440. Starting from a fully-developed
turbulent velocity field at that Re_{\tau}, the oscillatory flow either
relaminarises or reaches a conditionally turbulent or strongly asymmetric state
depending on Wo. The numerical method is validated by demonstrating excellent
agreement of our DNS results with experimental data and analytical predictions
from literature for the limiting cases of non-oscillating but turbulent and
oscillating but laminar pipe flow. For an oscillating turbulent pipe flow we
further found a very good agreement between qualitative descriptions of the
characteristic flow features observed in experiments and our DNS. Here, we
focus on the observation of a strongly asymmetric behaviour between the
positive and the negative half-cycles of the oscillatory pipe flow at Wo=6.5.

2001.00932v1,2020-01-03,2020-01-03,The analogy of K-correction in the topic of gamma-ray bursts,"  It is well-known that there are two types of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs):
short/hard and long/soft ones, respectively. The long GRBs are coupled to
supernovae, but the short ones are associated with the so called macronovae
(also known as kilonovae), which can serve as the sources of gravitational
waves as well. The kilonovae can arise from the merging of two neutron-stars.
The neutron stars can be substituded by more massive black holes as well.
Hence, the topic of gamma-ray bursts (mainly the topic of short ones) and the
topic of massive binaries, are strongly connected.
  In this contribution, the redshifts of GRBs are studied. The surprising
result - namely that the apparently fainter GRBs can be in average at smaller
distances - is discussed again. In essence, the results of M\'esz\'aros et al.
(2011) are studied again using newer samples of GRBs. The former result is
confirmed by the newer data.

observationally. The long ones are coupled to supernovae type Ib/Ic - the short
ones are connected to the merging of two neutron stars, where one or even both
neutron stars can be substituted by black holes. These short GRBs - as merging
binaries - can also serve as the sources of gravitation waves, and are
observable as the recently detected macronovae. Since 1998 there are several
statistical studies suggesting the existence of more than two subgroups. There
can be a subgroup having an intermediate durations; there can be a subgroup
with ultra-long durations; the long/soft subgroup itself can be divided into
two subclasses with respect to the luminosity of GRBs. The authors with other
collaborators provided several statistical studies in this topic. This field of
the GRB-diversity is briefly surveyed in this contribution.

realization that pairwise collisions are treated far too simply. Here, and in
our companion paper (Cambioni et al. 2019) that introduces the training
methodology, we demonstrate the first application of machine learning to more
realistically model the late stage of planet formation by giant impacts. We
present surrogate models that give fast, reliable answers for the masses and
velocities of the two largest remnants of a giant impact, as a function of the
colliding masses and their impact velocity and angle, with the caveat that our
training data do not yet include pre-impact rotation or variable thermal
conditions. We compare canonical N-body scenarios of terrestrial planet
formation assuming perfect merger (Chambers 2001) with our more realistic
treatment that includes inefficient accretions and hit-and-run collisions. The
result is a protracted tail of final events lasting ~200 Myr, and the
conversion of about half the mass of the initial population to debris. We
obtain profoundly different solar system architectures, featuring a much wider
range of terrestrial planet masses and enhanced compositional diversity.

  (HISA) towards a Giant Molecular Filament","  Molecular clouds form from the atomic phase of the interstellar medium.
However, characterizing the transition between the atomic and the molecular
interstellar medium (ISM) is a difficult observational task. Here we address
cloud formation processes by combining HSIA with molecular line data. One
scenario proposed by numerical simulations is that the column density
probability density functions (N-PDF) evolves from a log-normal shape at early
times to a power-law-like shape at later times. In this paper, we study the
cold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38a (d=3.4 kpc,
length$\sim230$ pc). We identify an extended HISA feature, which is partly
correlated with the 13CO emission. The peak velocities of the HISA and 13CO
observations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity
offset of approximately 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found on the western side. The sonic
Mach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large
fraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at
subsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM is on the
order of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density of molecular
hydrogen is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI
emission (WNM+CNM), and 13CO (molecular component) are well described by
log-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the
main driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows
a power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We
suggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the
filament. The eastern subregion seems to be forming a molecular cloud out of
the atomic gas, whereas the western subregion already shows high column density
peaks, active star formation and evidence of related feedback processes.

vibrations of the substrate. As previously evidenced
\cite{Brunet07,Brunet09,Noblin09}, the mechanical vibrations induce drop
deformations which combine axisymmetric and antisymmetric modes. In this paper,
we establish quantitative trends from experiments conducted within a large
range of parameters, namely the amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$ of the forcing,
the liquid viscosity $\eta$ and the angle between the substrate and the forcing
axis $\alpha$. These experiments are carried out on weak-pinning substrates.
For most parameters sets, the averaged velocity $<v>$ grows linearly with $A$.
We extract the mobility, defined as $s=\frac{\Delta <v>}{\Delta A}$. It is
found that $s$ can show a sharp maximal value close to the resonance frequency
of the first axisymmetric mode $f_p$. The value of $s$ tends to be almost
independent on $\eta$ below 50 cSt, while $s$ decreases significantly for
higher $\eta$. Also, it is found that for peculiar sets of parameters,
particularly with $f$ far enough from $f_p$, the drop moves in the reverse
direction. Finally, we draw a relationship between $<v>$ and the averaged
values of the dynamical contact angles at both sides of the drop over one
period of oscillation.

To this end, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem of a two-dimensional surface
defined by a generalized Jacobi metric. The spacetime is asymptotically
non-flat due to the existence of a bumblebee vector field. Thus the deflection
angle is modified and can be divided into three parts: the surface integral of
the Gaussian curvature, the path integral of a geodesic curvature of the
particle ray and the change in the coordinate angle. In addition, we also
obtain the same results by defining the deflection angle. The effects of the
Lorentz breaking constant on the gravitational lensing are analyzed. In
particular, we correct a mistake in the previous literature. Furthermore, we
consider the finite-distance correction for the deflection angle of massive
particles.

thermal engines (i.e. dish-Stirling systems) are among the most efficient
generators of solar power currently available. This study focuses on the
modelling of functioning data from a 32 kWe dish-Stirling solar plant installed
at a facility test site on the University of Palermo campus, in Southern Italy.
The proposed model, based on real monitored data, the energy balance of the
collector and the partial load efficiency of the Stirling engine, can be used
easily to simulate the annual energy production of such systems, making use of
the solar radiation database, with the aim of encouraging a greater
commercialisation of this technology. Introducing further simplifying
assumptions based on our experimental data, the model can be linearised
providing a new analytical expression of the parameters that characterise the
widely used Stine empirical model. The model was calibrated against data
corresponding to the collector with clean mirrors and used to predict the net
electric production of the dish-Stirling accurately. A numerical method for
assessing the daily level of mirror soiling without the use of direct
reflectivity measures was also defined. The proposed methodology was used to
evaluate the history of mirror soiling for the observation period, which shows
a strong correlation with the recorded sequence of rains and dust depositions.
The results of this study emphasise how desert dust transport events, frequent
occurrences in parts of the Mediterranean, can have a dramatic impact on the

dynamical crossover that is similar to the Wigner-Seitz radius used in

with annealed randomness, and the modified one, with quenched randomness. In
the original model, each voter changes its opinion with a certain probability
$\epsilon$ if the group of influence is not unanimous. In contrast, the
modified version introduces two types of voters that act in a deterministic way
in case of disagreement in the influence group: the fraction $\epsilon$ of
voters always change their current opinion, whereas the rest of them always
maintain it. Although both concepts of randomness lead to the same average
number of opinion changes in the system on the microscopic level, they cause
qualitatively distinct results on the macroscopic level. We focus on the
mean-field description of these models. Our approach relies on the stability
analysis by the linearization technique developed within dynamical system
theory. This approach allows us to derive complete, exact phase diagrams for
both models. The results obtained in this paper indicate that quenched
randomness promotes continuous phase transitions to a greater extent, whereas
annealed randomness favors discontinuous ones. The quenched model also creates
combinations of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions unobserved in
the annealed model, in which the up-down symmetry may be spontaneously broken
inside or outside the hysteresis loop. The analytical results are confirmed by
Monte Carlo simulations carried out on a complete graph.

of our sample for a period of approximately nine years from 2008 August to 2017

month-like time scales, 371/481 FSRQs are variable ( 80%), while only about 50%

than BL Lac objects. We find a mean F_var of 0.55 +/- 0.33 and 0.47 +/- 0.29
for FSRQs and BL Lacs respectively. Large F_var in FSRQs is also confirmed from
the analysis of the ensemble structure function. By Dividing our sample of
blazars based on the position of the synchrotron peak in their broad-band
spectral energy distribution, we find that the low synchrotron peaked (LSP)
sources have the largest mean F_var value of 0.54 +/- 0.32 while the
intermediate synchrotron peaked (ISP) and high synchrotron peaked (HSP) sources

the F_var and time scale of variability ({\tau}) do not correlate with the
black hole mass. We note that F_var is found to be weakly correlated with
Doppler factor ({\delta}) and {\tau} is also weakly correlated with {\delta}.
Most of the sources in our sample have {\tau} of the order of days, which might
be related to processes in the jet. We find marginal difference in the

vehicle fuel consumption levels. Eco-driving systems are one method to improve
vehicle energy efficiency with the help of vehicle connectivity. In this paper,
an eco-driving system is developed that computes a fuel-optimized vehicle
trajectory while traversing more than one signalized intersection. The system
is designed in a modular and scalable fashion allowing it to be implemented in
large networks without significantly increasing the computational complexity.
The proposed system utilizes signal phasing and timing (SPaT) data that are
communicated to connected vehicles (CVs) together with real-time vehicle
dynamics to compute fuel-optimum trajectories. The proposed algorithm is
incorporated in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation
software to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of various variables,
including: system market penetration rates (MPRs), demand levels, phase splits,
offsets and traffic signal spacings on the system performance. The analysis
shows that at 100\% MPR, fuel consumption can be reduced by as high as 13.8\%.
Moreover, higher MPRs and shorter phase lengths result in larger fuel savings.
Optimum demand levels and traffic signal spacings exist that maximize the
effectiveness of the algorithm. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the
algorithm works less effective when the traffic signal offset is closer to its
optimal value. Finally, the study highlights the need for further work to

  Approaches Using Probe Vehicle Data","  This paper presents a novel method for estimating the number of vehicles
traveling along signalized approaches using probe vehicle data only. The
proposed method uses the Kalman Filtering technique to produce reliable vehicle
count estimates using real-time probe vehicle estimates of the expected travel
times. The proposed method introduces a novel variable estimation interval that
allows for higher estimation precision, as the updating time interval always
contains a fixed number of probe vehicles. The proposed method is evaluated
using empirical and simulated data, the former of which were collected along a
signalized roadway in downtown Blacksburg, VA. Results indicate that vehicle
count estimates produced by the proposed method are accurate. The paper also
examines the model's accuracy when installing a single stationary sensor (e.g.,
loop detector), producing slight improvements especially when the probe vehicle
market penetration rate is low. Finally, the paper investigates the sensitivity
of the estimation model to traffic demand levels, showing that the model works
better at higher demand levels given that more probe vehicles exist for the
same market penetration rate.

  between global and gauge symmetries","  We study the nature of the finite-temperature transition of the
three-dimensional scalar chromodynamics with N_f flavors. These models are
constructed by considering maximally O(M)-symmetric multicomponent scalar
models, whose symmetry is partially gauged to obtain SU(N_c) gauge theories,
with a residual nonabelian global symmetry given by U(N_f) for N_c>2 and
Sp(N_f) for N_c=2, so that M = 2 N_c N_f. We find that their finite-temperature
transition is continuous for N_f=2 and for all values of Nc we investigated,
N_c=2,3,4. Such continuous transitions belong to universality classes related
to the global symmetry group of the theory. For N_c=2 it belongs to the
SO(5)=Sp(2)/Z_2 universality class, while for N_c>2 it belongs to the
SO(3)=SU(2)/Z_2 universality class. For N_f>2, the transition is always of
first order. These results match the predictions obtained by using the
effective Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach in terms of a gauge-invariant order
parameter. Our results indicate that the nonabelian gauge degrees of freedom
are irrelevant at the transition. These conclusions are supported by an
analysis of gauge-field dependent correlation functions, that are always
short-ranged, even at the transition.

the recent advances in the asymptotic analysis of Fredholm integral equations
of the second kind with finite support, here we study the one governing the
circular capacitor, known as the Love equation. We found analytically many new
subleading terms in the capacitance at small separations. We also calculated
the asymptotic expansion at large separations, thus providing the two simple
expressions which practically describe the capacitance at all distances. The
approach described here could be used to find exact analytical expansions for
the capacitance to an arbitrary number of terms in both regimes of small and

  observations of GRB 190114C","  Very high energy photons from cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are
expected to interact with extragalactic background light (EBL) and produce
electron-positron pairs when they propagate through intergalactic medium (IGM).
These relativistic pairs will then up-scatter cosmic microwave background (CMB)
photons and emit secondary GeV emission. Meanwhile, the motion of these pairs
are deflected by intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), so the secondary GeV
photons arrive later than the primary emission. It has been suggested that the
properties of the secondary GeV emission can be used to constrain IGMF.
Recently, TeV gamma-ray emission has been detected, for the first time, from a
GRB (GRB 190114C) by the MAGIC telescope and its steep ${\rm \gamma-ray}$
spectrum shows a clear evidence of absorption by EBL. We then constrain the
IGMF with the GeV flux limit obtained from the $Fermi$-LAT observations. We
find a limit of $>10^{-19.5}$ G for the coherence length of $\lambda \leq 1$
Mpc. Although this limit is weaker than that obtained by using blazars, it
represents the first limit from ${\rm \gamma-ray}$ observations of GRBs, which
provides an independent constraint on IGMF. We also find that, for transient
${\rm \gamma-ray}$ sources, one can choose a favorable time window to search
for the echo emission at a particular energy.

optical quality, describe the inspection method based on Zernike polynomials,
discuss the field dependence of the finesse and its consequences for instrument
design, and investigate the impact of the measurement technique to achieve

etalon coatings, i.e., lowering the peak transmission and leaving an imprint of
the pupil of the GREGOR solar telescope on the etalon that is directly exposed
to sunlight. The finesse of both etalons, however, remains high so that the
impact on imaging spectropolarimetry is negligible.

nanoparticles assisted by the nonreciprocal graphene plasmons waveguides is
proposed in this work. The thermal diode system consists of two particles and a
drift-biased suspended graphene sheet in close proximity of them. Nonreciprocal
graphene plasmons are induced by the drift currents in the graphene sheet, and
then couple to the waves emitted by the particles in near-field regime. Based
on the asymmetry with respect to their propagation direction of graphene
plasmons, the thermal rectification between the two particles is observed. The
performance of the radiative thermal diode can be actively adjusted through
tuning the chemical potential or changing the drift currents in the graphene
sheet. With a large drift velocity and a small chemical potential, a perfect
radiative thermal diode with a rectification coefficient extremely approaching
to 1 can be achieved within a wide range of the interparticle distance from
near to far-field. The dispersion relations of the graphene plasmons are
adopted to analyze the underlying physics of the rectification effect. In
addition, due to the wide band characteristic of the nonreciprocal graphene
plasmons, the driftbiased graphene can act as a universal platform for the
thermal rectification between particles. The particles with a larger particle
resonance frequency are much more preferred to produce a better thermal diode.

orders greater than obtained in conventional accelerators. Focusing of electron
and positron beams by wakefield, excited in plasma, in electron-positron
collider is very important. The focusing mechanism in the plasma, in which all
electron bunches of a sequence are focused identically, has been proposed by
authors earlier. The mechanism of focusing of a sequence of relativistic
positron bunches in plasma, in which all positron bunches of sequence are
focused identically and uniformly, has been investigated in this paper by
numerical simulation by 2.5D code LCODE. We numerically simulate the
self-consistent radial dynamics of lengthy positron bunches in homogeneous
plasma. In simulation we use the hydrodynamic description of plasma. In other
words, the plasma is considered to be cold electron liquid, and positron
bunches are aggregate of macroparticles. Positron bunches are considered to be
homogeneous cylinders in the longitudinal direction. Positrons in bunches are
distributed in radial direction according to Gaussian distribution. It is shown
that in this case only first bunch is in the finite longitudinal electrical
wakefield notequal to zero. Other bunches are in zero longitudinal electrical
wakefield Ez=0. Between bunches of this sequence longitudinal electrical
wakefield and radial force are not zero. The focusing radial force in regions,
occupied by bunches, is constant along each bunch Fr=const. Between bunches the
radial force is inhomogeneous. All positron bunches of sequence are focused
identically and uniformly.

2001.01250v1,2020-01-05,2020-01-05,Longitudinal filament oscillations enhanced by two C-class flares,"  In this paper, we report the multiwavelength observations of a very long
filament in active region (AR) 11112 on 2010 October 18. The filament was
composed of two parts, the eastern part (EP) and western part (WP). We focus on
longitudinal oscillations of the EP, which were enhanced by two homologous
C-class flares in the same AR. The C1.3 flare was confined without a CME. Both
EP and WP of the filament were slightly disturbed and survived the flare. After
5 hrs, eruption of the WP generated a C2.6 flare and a narrow, jet-like CME.
Three oscillating threads (thd$_a$, thd$_b$, thd$_c$) are obviously identified
in the EP and their oscillations are naturally divided into three phases by the
two flares. The initial amplitude ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of
$\sim$14 Mm. The period ranges from 34 to 73 minutes with a mean value of
$\sim$53 minutes. The curvature radii of the magnetic dips are estimated to be
29 to 133 Mm with a mean value of $\sim$74 Mm. The damping times ranges from
$\sim$62 to $\sim$96 minutes with a mean value of $\sim$82 minutes. The value
of $\tau/P$ is between 1.2 and 1.8. For thd$_a$ in the EP, the amplitudes were
enhanced by the two flares from 6.1 Mm to 6.8 Mm after the C1.3 flare and
further to 21.4 Mm after the C2.6 flare. The period variation as a result of
perturbation from the flares was within 20\%. The attenuation became faster
after the C2.6 flare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
large-amplitude, longitudinal filament oscillations enhanced by flares.
Numerical simulations reproduce the oscillations of thd$_a$ very well. The
simulated amplitudes and periods are close to the observed values, while the
damping time in the last phase is longer, implying additional mechanisms should
be taken into account apart from radiative loss.

external circuit capacitance C and resistance Ri, but the variation of Ri is
more promising from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a ""weak"" coupling,
synchronization is accompanied by attraction effect and decrease of the main
spectra harmonics width. In the case of a ""strong"" coupling, the number of
effects increases, synchronization can occur on subharmonics resulting in
multilevel stable synchronization of two oscillators. An advanced algorithm for
synchronization efficiency and subharmonic ratio calculation is proposed. It is
shown that of the two oscillators the leading one is that with a higher main
frequency, and, in addition, the frequency stabilization effect is observed.
Also, in the case of a strong thermal coupling, the limit of the supply current
parameters, for which the oscillations exist, expands by ~ 10 %. The obtained
results have a universal character and open up a new kind of coupling in ONNs,
namely, T-coupling, which allows for easy transition from 2D to 3D integration.
The effect of subharmonic synchronization hold promise for application in
classification and pattern recognition.

model that possesses a softly-broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. However, the
physical consequences of the model cannot depend on the basis of scalar fields
used to define it. Thus, to get a better sense of the significance of the C2HDM

formalism. This formalism involves transforming to the Higgs basis (which is
defined up to an arbitrary complex phase) and identifying quantities that are
invariant with respect to this phase degree of freedom. Using this method, we
have obtained the constraints that enforce the softly-broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. One can then relate the C2HDM parameters to basis-independent
quantities up to a two-fold ambiguity. We then show how this remaining
ambiguity is resolved. We also examine the possibility of spontaneous CP
violation when the scalar potential of the C2HDM is explicitly CP-conserving.
Basis-independent constraints are presented that govern the presence of

clusters are completely mass segregated at birth. As a star cluster evolves
dynamically, these initial conditions are gradually lost. For star clusters
with single stars only and a canonical IMF, it has been suggested that traces
of these initial conditions vanish at $\tau_{\rm v}$ between 3 and 3.5
half-mass relaxation times. By the means of numerical models, here we
investigate the role of the primordial binary population on the loss of
primordial mass segregation. We found that $\tau_{\rm v}$ does not seem to
depend on the binary star distribution, yielding $3 < \tau_{\rm v} / t_{\rm rh}
< 3.5$. We also conclude that the completely mass segregated clusters, even
with binaries, are more compatible with the present-day ONC than the

these puzzling objects using new hydrogen-helium-silicon FASTWIND models and a
different fitting approach to re-evaluate their physical properties. Our new
analysis confirms that these stars indeed have properties that are typical of
late O-type dwarfs. We also present the first estimates of silicon abundances
for O-type stars in the 30 Dor clusters NGC 2060 and NGC 2070, with a weighted
mean abundance for our sample of 7.05 +/- 0.03. Our values are about 0.20 dex
lower than those previously derived for B-type stars in the LMC clusters N 11
and NGC 2004 using TLUSTY models. Various possibilities (e.g. differences in
the analysis methods, effects of microturbulence, and real differences between
stars in different clusters) were considered to account for these results. We
also used our grid of FASTWIND models to reassess the impact of using the
Galactic classification criteria for late O-type stars in the LMC by
scrutinising their sensitivity to different stellar properties. At the cool
edge of the O star regime the HeII 4686/HeI 4713 ratio used to assign
luminosity class for Galactic stars can mimic giants or bright giants in the
LMC, even for objects with high gravities (log_g > 4.0 dex). We argue that this
line ratio is not a reliable luminosity diagnostic for late O-type stars in the
LMC, and that the SiIV 4989/HeI4026 ratio is more robust for these types.

the experimental eigenvector estimates agree well with numerical simulations if
certain consistency conditions imposed by system symmetries are taken into
account. In the Hermitian case, these estimates are obtained from resonance
spectra alone without knowledge of the system parameters. It remains an
interesting problem of physical relevance to find conditions under which the
full non-Hermitian eigenvector set can be obtained from the spectra alone.

  young stellar object G107.298+5.639","  Periodic flares of maser emission are thought to be induced either by
variations of the seed photon flux in young binary systems or the pump rate
regulated by stellar and accretion luminosities. We seek to study the
variability of four maser transitions of three different species in
G107.298+5.639 to constrain the dominant mechanism of periodic flares. Light
curves of the 6.7 GHz methanol and 22.2 GHz water vapour maser were obtained
with the Torun 32m radio telescope over 39 and 34 cycles, respectively. The
target was also monitored at the 1.6 GHz hydroxyl transitions with the
Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope over 13 cycles. All these maser lines were imaged
using VLBI arrays. The study confirms alternating flares of the methanol and
water masers with a period of 34.4d and reveals the synchronised behaviour of
the methanol and hydroxyl masers in this source. The observed spatial
distribution of the methanol maser cloudlets and the measured time delays of
the flares of individual features imply a ring-like structure of radius 240au
and thickness 30au. Internal proper motions indicate that the velocity of
methanol cloudlets is dominated by a disc-wind component of about 5km/s. The
methanol emission detected during only one VLBI observation is located in a
region about 550au from a central star, which also exhibits OH maser flares.
The erratic appearance of methanol features can be related to a powering object
of relatively low luminosity which, during some variability cycles, can excite
molecules only in the nearest part of the disc. A careful analysis of the maser
and infrared light curves reveal a strong correlation between the 6.7 GHz line
and the infrared flux densities supporting a radiative pumping of the maser.
The synchronised behaviour of the hydroxyl and methanol transitions indicates a
common pumping mechanism for the periodic flares of G107.298+5.639.

  to 2015 with MAGIC","  M87 is one of the closest (z=0.00436) extragalactic sources emitting at
very-high-energies (VHE, E > 100 GeV). The aim of this work is to locate the
region of the VHE gamma-ray emission and to describe the observed broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) during the low VHE gamma-ray state. The data
from M87 collected between 2012 and 2015 as part of a MAGIC monitoring
programme are analysed and combined with multi-wavelength data from Fermi-LAT,
Chandra, HST, EVN, VLBA and the Liverpool Telescope. The averaged VHE gamma-ray
spectrum can be fitted from 100GeV to 10TeV with a simple power law with a
photon index of (-2.41 $\pm$ 0.07), while the integral flux above 300GeV is
$(1.44 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. During the campaign between
2012 and 2015, M87 is generally found in a low emission state at all observed
wavelengths. The VHE gamma-ray flux from the present 2012-2015 M87 campaign is
consistent with a constant flux with some hint of variability ($\sim3\sigma$)
on a daily timescale in 2013. The low-state gamma-ray emission likely
originates from the same region as the flare-state emission. Given the
broadband SED, both a leptonic synchrotron self Compton and a hybrid
photo-hadronic model reproduce the available data well, even if the latter is
preferred. We note, however, that the energy stored in the magnetic field in
the leptonic scenario is very low suggesting a matter dominated emission
region.

  symmetry in CeB6","  In contrast to magnetic order formed by electrons' dipolar moments, ordering
phenomena associated with higher-order multipoles (quadrupoles, octupoles,
etc.) are more difficult to characterize because of the limited choice of
experimental probes that can distinguish different multipolar moments. The
heavy-fermion compound CeB6 and its La-diluted alloys are among the
best-studied realizations of the long-range-ordered multipolar phases, often
referred to as ""hidden order"". Previously the hidden order in phase II was
identified as primary antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) and field-induced octupolar
(AFO) order. Here we present a combined experimental and theoretical
investigation of collective excitations in the phase II of CeB6. Inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) in fields up to 16.5 T reveals a new high-energy mode
above 14 T in addition to the low-energy magnetic excitations. The experimental
dependence of their energy on the magnitude and angle of the applied magnetic
field is compared to the results of a multipolar interaction model. The
magnetic excitation spectrum in rotating field is calculated within a localized
approach using the pseudo-spin presentation for the Gamma8 states. We show that
the rotating-field technique at fixed momentum can complement conventional INS
measurements of the dispersion at constant field and holds great promise for
identifying the symmetry of multipolar order parameters and the details of
inter-multipolar interactions that stabilize hidden-order phases.

to theoretical yields. The sub-solar yield from Type Ia SNe
($\mathrm{[Mn/Fe]}_{\mathrm{Ia}}=-0.30_{-0.03}^{+0.03}$ at
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1.5$ dex, with negligible dependence on metallicity) implies
that sub-Chandrasekhar-mass (sub-$M_{\mathrm{Ch}}$) white dwarf progenitors are
the dominant channel of Type Ia SNe at early times in this galaxy, although
some fraction ($\gtrsim20\%$) of $M_{\mathrm{Ch}}$ Type Ia or Type Iax SNe are
still needed to produce the observed yield. However, this result does not hold
in all environments. In particular, we find that dSph galaxies with extended
star formation histories (Leo I, Fornax dSphs) appear to have higher [Mn/Fe] at
a given metallicity than galaxies with early bursts of star formation (Sculptor
dSph), suggesting that $M_{\mathrm{Ch}}$ progenitors may become the dominant

small tidal fields, the superradiant ""cloud"" puffs up by transitioning to
excited states and acquires a new spatial distribution through transitions to
higher multipoles, establishing new equilibrium configurations.For large tidal
fields the scalar condensates are disrupted; we determine numerically the
critical tidal moments for this to happen and find good agreement with
Newtonian estimates. We show that the impact of tides can be relevant for known
black-hole systems such as the one at the center of our galaxy or the Cygnus

layout of conceptual associations between positively/negatively/neutrally

constructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed
positive/neutral mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and,
``scientist''. Students' conceptual associations of ``scientist'' were highly
positive and largely non-stereotypical, although links about the ``mad
scientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex
figure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission
but also to negative sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School''
elicited stronger differences between the two groups. In the students' mindset,
``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura or set of associations,
indicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic
concepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and
exam-related notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included
concepts of fun, friendship, and personal growth instead. Along the perspective
of Education Research, the above results are discussed as quantitative evidence

but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90% credible intervals
for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 $M_{\odot}$ (1.45 to 1.88

smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual

those of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one

2001.01787v1,2020-01-06,2020-01-06,"Primordial nucleosynthesis with varying fundamental constants: Improved
  constraints and a possible solution to the Lithium problem","  Primordial nucleosynthesis is an observational cornerstone of the Hot Big
Bang model and a sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model. Its
success has been limited by the so-called Lithium problem, for which many
solutions have been proposed. We report on a self-consistent perturbative
analysis of the effects of variations in nature's fundamental constants, which
are unavoidable in most extensions of the standard model, on primordial
nucleosynthesis, focusing on a broad class of Grand Unified Theory models. A
statistical comparison between theoretical predictions and observational
measurements of ${}^4$He, D, ${}^3$He and, ${}^7$Li consistently yields a
preferred value of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ at the nucleosynthesis
epoch that is larger than the current laboratory one. The level of statistical
significance and the preferred extent of variation depend on model assumptions
but the former can be more than four standard deviations, while the latter is
always compatible with constraints at lower redshifts. If Lithium is not
included in the analysis, the preference for a variation of $\alpha$ is not
statistically significant. The abundance of ${}^3$He is relatively insensitive
to such variations. Our analysis highlights a viable and physically motivated
solution to the Lithium problem, which warrants further study.

2001.01797v1,2020-01-06,2020-01-06,"Bridge Modal Identification using Acceleration Measurements within
  Moving Vehicles","  Vehicles crossing bridge structures respond dynamically to the bridge's
vibrations. An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a
trace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such
as the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This
paper introduces two methods for the bridge system identification using data
collected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle
suspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency
domain. The first approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the
second uses EEMD method. Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted using
second-order blind identification (SOBI) method. After these two processes the
resulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the
bridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identification using mobile sensor
data has been recently introduced as STRIDEX algorithm. The processed mobile
sensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the
bridge. The performance of the methods is validated on numerical case studies
of a long single-span bridge monitored via a network of moving vehicles. The
analyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that the
proposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and
produce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study
shows that the proposed transfer function method can efficiently deconvolve the
linear dynamics of a moving vehicle. EEMD method is able to extract vehicle
dynamic response without a-priori information about the vehicle. This study is
the first proposed methodology for complete bridge modal identification,
including operational natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios using
\textit{moving vehicles sensor data}.

  Gravity","  In this work, a subclass of the generalized Kerr-Schild class of spacetimes
is specified, with respect to which the Ricci tensor (regardless of the
position of indices) proves to be linear in the so-called profile function of
the geometry. Considering Colombeau's nonlinear theory of generalized
functions, this result is extended to apply to an associated class of
distributional Kerr-Schild geometries, and then used to formulate a variational
principle for these singular spacetimes. More specifically, it is shown in this
regard that a variation of a suitably regularized Einstein-Hilbert action can
be performed even if the metric of one of the corresponding generalized
Kerr-Schild representatives contains a generalized delta function that
converges in a suitable limit to a delta distribution.

de Haas oscillations in (010) (AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 heterostructures,
spin-splitting of the Landau levels in the (010) Ga2O3 two-dimensional electron

from the Zeeman effect. By fitting the both the first and second harmonic of

  within a three-body model","  Background$\colon$ The $^{29}$F system is located at the lower-N boundary of
the ""island of inversion"" and is an exotic, weakly bound system. Little is
known about this system beyond its two-neutron separation energy ($S_{2n}$)
with large uncertainties. A similar situation is found for the low-lying
spectrum of its unbound binary subsystem $^{28}$F.
  Purpose$\colon$ To investigate the configuration mixing, matter radius and
neutron-neutron correlations in the ground state of $^{29}$F within a
three-body model, exploring the possibility of $^{29}$F to be a two-neutron
halo nucleus.
  Method$\colon$ The $^{29}$F ground-state wave function is built within the
hyperspherical formalism by using an analytical transformed harmonic oscillator
basis. The Gogny-Pires-Tourreil (GPT) nn interaction with central, spin-orbit
and tensor terms is employed in the present calculations, together with
different core$+n$ potentials constrained by the available experimental
information on $^{28}$F.
  Results$\colon$ The $^{29}$F ground-state configuration mixing and its matter
radius are computed for different choices of the $^{28}$F structure and
$S_{2n}$ value. The admixture of d-waves with pf components are found to play
an important role, favoring the dominance of dineutron configurations in the
wave function. Our computed radii show a mild sensitivity to the $^{27}$F$+n$
potential and $S_{2n}$ values. The relative increase of the matter radius with
respect to the $^{27}$F core lies in the range 0.1-0.4 fm depending upon these
choices.
  Conclusions$\colon$ Our three-body results for $^{29}$F indicate the presence
of a moderate halo structure in its ground state, which is enhanced by larger
intruder components. This finding calls for an experimental confirmation.

influencing the time of forward and reverse electrical switching, that
determine the applicability limits of the proposed model, are identified. For
the resistive coupling, it is shown that synchronization takes place at a
certain value of the coupling resistance, though it is unstable and a
synchronization failure occurs periodically. For the capacitive coupling, two
synchronization modes, with weak and strong coupling, are found. The transition
between these modes is accompanied by chaotic oscillations. A decrease in the
width of the spectrum harmonics in the weak-coupling mode, and its increase in
the strong-coupling one, is detected. The dependences of frequencies and phase
differences of the coupled oscillatory circuits on the coupling capacitance are
found. Examples of operation of coupled VO2 oscillators as a central pattern

approximately isotropically distributed over the whole sky, but the
last-generation UHECR detector arrays, the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and
the Telescope Array (TA), have detected thousands of events, allowing us to
study small deviations from isotropy. So far, Auger has detected a large-scale
anisotropy consistent with a $\sim 6.5\%$ dipole moment in the distribution of
cosmic rays with $E > 8$~EeV, and both collaborations have reported indications
for smaller-scale anisotropies at higher energies. On the other hand, neither
array has full-sky coverage, the Auger field of view being limited to
declinations $\delta < +45^\circ$ and the TA one to $\delta > -16^\circ$.
Searches for anisotropies with full-sky coverage thus require combining data
from both arrays. A working group with members from both collaborations has
been established for this task. Since even a minor systematic error in the
energy determinations at either of the arrays could result in a sizeable
spurious anisotropy along the north--south axis, we devised a method to
cross-calibrate the energy scales of the two experiments with respect to each
other by using events in a declination band within the intersection of their
fields of view. In this contribution, we report on both updates on blind
searches for anisotropies and the first full-sky studies of flux models based
on possible local extragalactic sources.

diagnosis, law, education had propelled the need for interpretable techniques
due to the need for end users to understand the reasoning behind decisions due
to learning systems. The computational intractability of interpretable learning
led practitioners to design heuristic techniques, which fail to provide sound
handles to tradeoff accuracy and interpretability.
  Motivated by the success of MaxSAT solvers over the past decade, recently
MaxSAT-based approach, called MLIC, was proposed that seeks to reduce the
problem of learning interpretable rules expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form
(CNF) to a MaxSAT query. While MLIC was shown to achieve accuracy similar to
that of other state of the art black-box classifiers while generating small
interpretable CNF formulas, the runtime performance of MLIC is significantly
lagging and renders approach unusable in practice. In this context, authors
raised the question: Is it possible to achieve the best of both worlds, i.e., a
sound framework for interpretable learning that can take advantage of MaxSAT
solvers while scaling to real-world instances?
  In this paper, we take a step towards answering the above question in
affirmation. We propose IMLI: an incremental approach to MaxSAT based framework
that achieves scalable runtime performance via partition-based training
methodology. Extensive experiments on benchmarks arising from UCI repository
demonstrate that IMLI achieves up to three orders of magnitude runtime
improvement without loss of accuracy and interpretability.

two-terminal MOM devices based on vanadium dioxide thin films. The switching
effect is associated with the metal-insulator phase transition. Relaxation
oscillations are observed in circuits with VO2-based switches. Dependences of
the oscillator critical frequency Fmax, threshold power and voltage, as well as
the time of current rise, on the switching structure size are obtained by
numerical simulation. The empirical dependence of the threshold voltage on the
switching region dimensions and film thickness is found. It is shown that, for
the VO2 channel sizes of 10*10 nm, Fmax can reach the value of 300 MHz at a
film thickness of ~20 nm. Next, it is shown that oscillatory neural networks
can be implemented on the basis of coupled VO2 oscillators. For the weak
capacitive coupling, we revealed the dependence of the phase difference upon
synchronization on the coupling capacitance value. When the switches are scaled
down, the limiting time of synchronization is reduced to Ts ~13 {\mu}s, and the
number of oscillation periods for the entering to the synchronization mode
remains constant, Ns ~ 17. In the case of weak thermal coupling in the
synchronization mode, we observe in-phase behavior of oscillators, and there is
a certain range of parameters of the supply current, in which the
synchronization effect becomes possible. With a decrease in dimensions, a
decrease in the thermal coupling action radius is observed, which can vary in
the range from 0.5 to 50 {\mu}m for structures with characteristic dimensions
of 0.1 to 5 {\mu}m, respectively. Thermal coupling may have a promising effect

periods can be determined, there are over hundred thousand stars, especially
with low photometric variability and irregular pattern of variations, for which

the period determination algorithms. We find that the success rate for
recovering the rotation signal has a minimum close to the solar metallicity
value. This can be explained by the compensation effect of facular and spot
contributions. In addition, selecting solar-like stars with near-solar
effective temperature, near solar photometric variability, and with metallicity
between M/H = -0.35 and M/H = 0.35 from the Kepler sample, we analyse the
fraction of stars for which rotational periods have been detected as a function

amplitude of $K_2' = 139 \pm 10$ km/s (90% confidence) tracks the secondary

sensor data on a real-time basis. Here, indoor air pollutant levels are
measured by a network of waspmote sensors while IAQI and humidex data are fused
together using an extended fractional-order Kalman filter (EFKF). According to
the obtained EIAQI, overall air quality alerts are provided in a timely fashion
for accurate prediction with enhanced performance against measurement noise and
nonlinearity. The estimation scheme is implemented by using the
fractional-order modeling and control (FOMCON) toolbox. A case study is
analysed to prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach.

  Solar Probe","  The physical mechanisms that produce the slow solar wind are still highly
debated. Parker Solar Probe's (PSP's) second solar encounter provided a new
opportunity to relate in situ measurements of the nascent slow solar wind with
white-light images of streamer flows. We exploit data taken by the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
(STEREO) and the Wide Imager on Solar Probe to reveal for the first time a
close link between imaged streamer flows and the high-density plasma measured
by the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) experiment. We identify
different types of slow winds measured by PSP that we relate to the
spacecraft's magnetic connectivity (or not) to streamer flows. SWEAP measured
high-density and highly variable plasma when PSP was well connected to
streamers but more tenuous wind with much weaker density variations when it
exited streamer flows. STEREO imaging of the release and propagation of small
transients from the Sun to PSP reveals that the spacecraft was continually
impacted by the southern edge of streamer transients. The impact of specific
density structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic field reversals
measured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the
streamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals
originating outside streamers. We tentatively interpret these findings in terms
of magnetic reconnection between open magnetic fields and coronal loops with
different properties, providing support for the formation of a subset of the
slow wind by magnetic reconnection.

the heart of different current scientific hot topics, namely plasmonics,
metamaterials and nanoantennas. Research in these disciplines during the last
decade has given rise to new, powerful concepts providing an unprecedented
degree of control over light manipulation at the nanoscale. However, only
recently have these concepts been used to increase the capabilities of light
processing in current photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which traditionally
rely only on dielectric materials with element sizes larger than the light
wavelength. Amongst the different PIC platforms, silicon photonics is expected
to become mainstream, since manufacturing using well-established CMOS processes
enables the mass production of low-cost PICs. In this review we discuss the
benefits of introducing recent concepts arisen from the fields of
metamaterials, plasmonics and nanoantennas into a silicon photonics integrated
platform. We review existing works in this direction and discuss how this
hybrid approach can lead to the improvement of current PICs enabling novel and

2001.02026v1,2020-01-07,2020-01-07,Radiation spectra of warm and optically thick coronae in AGN,"  A soft X-ray excess above the 2-10 keV power law extrapolation is generally
observed in AGN X-ray spectra. Presently there are two competitive models to
explain it: blurred ionized reflection and warm Comptonisation. In the latter
case, observations suggest a corona temperature $\sim$ 1 keV and a corona
optical depth $\sim$ 10. Moreover, radiative constraints from spectral fits
with Comptonisation models suggest that most of the accretion power should be
released in the warm corona. The disk below is basically non-dissipative,
radiating only the reprocessed emission from the corona. The true radiative
properties of such a warm and optically thick plasma are not well-known,
however. For instance, the importance of the Comptonisation process, the
potential presence of strong absorption/emission features or the spectral shape
of the output spectrum have been studied only very recently. We present in this
paper simulations of warm and optically thick coronae using the TITAN radiative
transfer code coupled with the NOAR Monte-Carlo code, the latter fully
accounting for Compton scattering of continuum and lines. Illumination from
above by a hard X-ray emission and from below by an optically thick accretion
disk is taken into account as well as (uniform) internal heating. Our
simulations show that for a large part of the parameter space, the warm corona
with sufficient internal mechanical heating is dominated by Compton cooling and
neither strong absorption nor emission lines are present in the outgoing
spectra. In a smaller part of the parameter space, the calculated emission
agrees with the spectral shape of the observed soft X-ray excess. Remarkably,
this also corresponds to the conditions of radiative equilibrium of an extended
warm corona covering almost entirely a non-dissipative accretion disk. These
results confirm the warm Comptonisation as a valuable model for the soft X-ray
excess.

characteristic in numerous condensed matter phenomena, including high
temperature superconductivity, quantum spin liquids, and topological
semimetals. In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), this causes
superconductivity to emerge in the vicinity of two other instabilities: nematic
and magnetic. Unveiling the mutual relationship among nematic order, spin
fluctuations, and superconductivity has been a major challenge for research in
FeSCs, but it is still controversial. Here, by carrying out 77Se nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on FeSe single crystals, doped by cobalt
and sulfur that serve as control parameters, we demonstrate that the
superconducting transition temperature Tc increases in proportion to the
strength of spin fluctuations, while it is independent of the nematic
transition temperature Tnem. Our observation therefore directly implies that
superconductivity in FeSe is essentially driven by spin fluctuations in the
intermediate coupling regime, while nematic fluctuations have a marginal impact
on Tc.

normally morph into a global bending cone shape with long rippled waves near

significantly affects the morphogenesis of leaves. To understand the
biophysical mechanism under such phenomena, we develop mathematical models that
can effectively account for inhomogeneous differential growth of floating and
free-standing leaves, to quantitatively predict formation and evolution of
their morphology. We find, both theoretically and experimentally, that the
short-wavelength buckled configuration is energetically favorable for growing
membranes lying on liquid, while the global buckling shape is more preferable
for suspended ones. Other influencing factors such as stem/vein, heterogeneity
and dimension are also investigated. Our results provide a fundamental insight
into a variety of plant morphogenesis affected by water foundation and suggest
that such surface instabilities can be harnessed for morphology control of

2001.02154v1,2020-01-07,2020-01-07,"Generalized geometrical coupling for vector field localization on thick
  brane in asymptotic Anti-de Sitter spacetime","  It is known that a five-dimensional free vector field $A_{M}$ cannot be
localized on Randall-Sundrum (RS)-like thick branes, namely, the thick branes
embedded in asymptotic Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In order to localize a
vector field on the RS-like thick brane, an extra coupling term should be
introduced. In this paper, we generalize the geometrical coupling mechanism by
adding two mass terms ($\alpha Rg^{MN}A_{M}A_{N}+\beta R^{MN}A_{M}A_{N}$) into
the action. We decompose the fundamental vector field $A_{M}$ into three parts:
transverse vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$, scalar parts $\phi$ and $A_{5}$. Then,
we find that the transverse vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ decouples from the
scalar parts. In order to eliminate the tachyonic modes of $\hat{A}_{\mu}$, the
two coupling parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ should satisfy a relation.
Combining the restricted condition, we can get a combination parameter as
$\gamma=\frac{3}{2}\pm\sqrt{1+12\alpha}$. Only if $\gamma>1/2$, the zero mode
of $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ can be localized on the RS-like thick brane. We also
investigate the resonant character of the vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ for the
general RS-like thick brane with the warp factor $A(z)=-\ln(1+k^2z^2)/2$ by
choosing the relative probability method. The result shows that, only for
$\gamma>3$, the massive resonant Kaluza-Klein modes can exist. The number of
resonant Kaluza-Klein states increases with the combination parameter $\gamma$,
and the lifetime of the first resonant state can be long enough as the age of
our universe. This indicates that the vector resonances might be considered as
one of the candidates of dark matter.

series of brightness temperature maps are constructed with the first version of

The angular resolution of the observations is set by the synthesized beam
(1.4x2.1as). The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork regions and
also elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops
as confirmed by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best
with the SDO/AIA 171, 131 and 304 channels in that they exhibit network
features and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints of large-scale
loops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band
3. The brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about
8000-9000K and in extreme moments up to 10 000K. ALMA Band 3 interferometric
observations from early observing cycles already reveal temperature differences
in the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the
correlation with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests though that the
radiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might have contributions from a larger range of
atmospheric heights than previously assumed but the exact formation height of
Band 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness
temperature scale as set by Total Power measurements remains less certain and
must be improved in the future. Despite these complications and the limited
angular resolution, ALMA Band 3 observations have large potential for
quantitative studies of the small-scale structure and dynamics of the solar

future interconnect nodes, much attention as been focused on evaluating the
electrical performance of Ru. The typical hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase
has been extensively studied, but relatively little attention has been paid to
the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase, which has been shown to nucleate in
confined structures and may be present in tight-pitch interconnects. Using
\emph{ab initio} techniques, we benchmark the performance of fcc Ru. We find
that the phonon-limited bulk resistivity of the fcc Ru is less than half of
that of hcp Ru, a feature we trace back to the stronger electron-phonon
coupling elements that are geometrically inherited from the modified Fermi
surface shape of the fcc crystal. Despite this benefit of the fcc phase, high
grain boundary scattering results in increased resistivity compared to Cu-based
interconnects with similar average grain size. We find, however, that the line
resistance of fcc Ru is lower than that of Cu below 21 nm line width due to the
conductor volume lost to adhesion and wetting liners. In addition to studying
bulk transport properties, we evaluate the performance of adhesion liners for
fcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for fcc Ru to bind
directly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as
TaN and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition
technique, we find that the vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru
can be up to eight times lower than that calculated for conventional liners
used for Cu interconnects. Our calculations, therefore, suggest that the
formation of the fcc phase of Ru may be a beneficial for advanced,
low-resistance interconnects.

  suggesting formation from the in-spiraling of globular clusters","  Studies of nucleated dwarf galaxies can constrain the scenarios for the
formation and evolution of nuclear star clusters (NSC) in low-mass galaxies and
give us insights on the origin of ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). We
report the discovery of a NSC in the dwarf galaxy KKs58 and investigate its
properties together with those of another NSC in KK197. Both NSCs are hosted by
dwarf elliptical galaxies of the Centaurus group. Combining ESO VLT MUSE data
with photometry from VLT FORS2, CTIO Blanco DECam, and HST ACS, as well as
high-resolution spectroscopy from VLT UVES, we analyse the photometric,
kinematic and stellar population properties of the NSCs and their host
galaxies. We confirm membership of the NSCs based on their radial velocities
and location close to the galaxy centres. We also confirm the membership of two
globular clusters (GCs) and detect oblate rotation in the main body of KK197.
Based on high signal-to-noise spectra taken with MUSE of the NSCs of both KKs58
and KK197 we measure low metallicities, [Fe/H] = $-1.75 \pm 0.06$ dex and
[Fe/H] = $-1.84 \pm 0.05$ dex, and stellar masses of $7.3 \times 10^5 M_\odot$
and $1.0 \times 10^6 M_\odot$, respectively. Both NSCs are more metal-poor than
their hosts that have metallicities of $-1.35 \pm 0.23$ dex (KKs58) and $-0.84
\pm 0.12$ dex (KK197). This can be interpreted as NSC formation via the
in-spiral of GCs. The masses, sizes and metallicities of the two NSCs place
them among other NSCs, but also among the known UCDs of the Centaurus group.
This indicates that NSCs might constitute the progenitors of a part of the

data to reconstruct the plasma properties from differential emission measure
(DEM) analysis for a previously studied long-lived, low-latitude coronal hole
(CH) over its lifetime of ten solar rotations. We initially obtain a
non-isothermal DEM distribution with a dominant component centered around 0.9
MK and a secondary smaller component at 1.5 - 2.0 MK. We find that deconvolving
the data with the instrument point spread function (PSF) to account for
long-range scattered light reduces the secondary hot component. Using the 2012
Venus transit and a 2013 lunar eclipse to test the efficiency of this
deconvolution, significant amounts of residual stray light are found for the
occulted areas. Accounting for this stray light in the error budget of the
different AIA filters further reduces the secondary hot emission, yielding CH
DEM distributions that are close to isothermal with the main contribution
centered around 0.9 MK. Based on these DEMs, we analyze the evolution of the
emission measure (EM), density, and averaged temperature during the CH's
lifetime. We find that once the CH is clearly observed in EUV images, the bulk
of the CH plasma reveals a quite constant state, i.e. temperature and density
reveal no major changes, whereas the total CH area and the photospheric
magnetic fine structure inside the CH show a distinct evolutionary pattern.
These findings suggest that CH plasma properties are mostly ""set"" at the CH
formation or/and that all CHs have similar plasma properties.

2001.02331v1,2020-01-08,2020-01-08,Active matter in a viscoelastic environment,"  Active matter systems such as eukaryotic cells and bacteria continuously
transform chemical energy to motion. Hence living systems exert active stresses
on the complex environments in which they reside. One recurring aspect of this
complexity is the viscoelasticity of the medium surrounding living systems:
bacteria secrete their own viscoelastic extracellular matrix, and cells
constantly deform, proliferate, and self-propel within viscoelastic networks of
collagen. It is therefore imperative to understand how active matter modifies,
and gets modified by, viscoelastic fluids. Here, we present a two-phase model
of active nematic matter that dynamically interacts with a passive viscoelastic
polymeric phase and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to
illustrate its applicability. Motivated by recent experiments we first study
the suppression of cell division by a viscoelastic medium surrounding the cell.
We further show that the self-propulsion of a model keratocyte cell is modified
by the polymer relaxation of the surrounding viscoelastic fluid in a
non-uniform manner and find that increasing polymer viscosity effectively
suppresses the cell motility. Lastly, we explore the hampering impact of the
viscoelastic medium on the generic hydrodynamic instabilities of active
nematics by simulating the dynamics of an active stripe within a polymeric
fluid. The model presented here can provide a framework for investigating more
complex dynamics such as the interaction of multicellular growing systems with
viscoelastic environments.

Motivated by this problem, we consider the $XY$ model of easy-plane

infinite lifetimes can still lead to a broad response. This forms the basis for
a new paradigm describing the interaction of experimental probes with a
physical system, where broadening is due neither to the lifetime, nor to the
emergence of fractional quasiparticles. Instead, strong fluctuations drive the
probe to absorb and radiate an infinite number of arbitrarily low energy
quasiparticles, leading us to draw parallels with the infrared catastrophe in

small amplitude, it is of significant interest to reconstruct and describe the
past grand minima on the basis of actual observations of the time. The Dalton
Minimum is often considered one of the grand minima captured in the coverage of
telescopic observations. Nevertheless, the reconstructions of the sunspot group
number vary significantly, and the existing butterfly diagrams have a large
data gap during the period. This is partially because most long-term
observations have remained unexplored in historical archives. Therefore, to
improve our understanding on the Dalton Minimum, we have located two series of
Thadd\""aus Derfflinger's observational records (a summary manuscript and
logbooks) as well as his Brander's 5.5-feet azimuthal-quadrant preserved in the
Kremsm\""unster Observatory. We have revised the existing Derfflinger's sunspot
group number with Waldmeier classification and eliminated all the existing
'spotless days' to remove contaminations from solar meridian observations. We
have reconstructed the butterfly diagram on the basis of his observations and
illustrated sunspot distributions in both solar hemispheres. Our article aims
to revise the trend of Derfflinger's sunspot group number and to bridge a data
gap of the existing butterfly diagrams around the Dalton Minimum. Our results
confirm that the Dalton Minimum is significantly different from the Maunder
Minimum, both in terms of cycle amplitudes and sunspot distributions.
Therefore, the Dalton Minimum is more likely a secular minimum in the long-term
solar activity, while further investigations for the observations at that time
are required.

  Ambient Temperature and Pressure","  The quasi-two-dimensional molecular semimetallic conductor
$\alpha$-STF$_2$I$_3$ is isostructural with $\alpha$-ET$_2$I$_3$.The latter
possesses a unique band structure showing a zero-gap state with Dirac cones
under high pressure, whereas the band structure of the former has been elusive
because of heavy disorder at all the donor sites. To elucidate the band
structure of $\alpha$-STF$_2$I$_3$, a theoretical method based on the observed
atomic parameters at 296 K and 1 bar has been proposed. The results suggest
that the STF salt should have a band structure with Dirac cones under ambient
pressure and temperature, which should promote future experimental studies on
this system.Using the extended H\""uckel method, we demonstrate that the Dirac
points of $\alpha$-STF$_2$I$_3$ are aligned to be symmetric with respect to a
time reversal invariant momentum (TRIM). Such novel Dirac cones, where the
energy difference between the conduction and valence bands has considerable
anisotropy, are clarified in terms of the parity of the wavefunction at the
TRIM. We propose the conductivity measurement on the present
$\alpha$-STF$_2$I$_3$, which is expected to show a large anisotropy as a
characteristic of the present Dirac electrons.

satellite of the giant spiral M101, and is known to have a prominent bulge that
is significantly off-set from the kinematic center of the underlying HI and
stellar disc. The youngest stars (age~ 100 Myr) trace a flocculent spiral
pattern extending out to ~8 kpc from the center of the galaxy. On the other

off-centred bulge and a large substructure residing in the South Western part
of the disc and not correlated with the spiral arms (SW over-density). The old
age of the stars in the SW over-density suggests that this may be another

  evolutionary status","  High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are exceptional astrophysical laboratories
that offer a rare glimpse into the physical processes that govern accretion on
compact objects, massive-star winds, and stellar evolution. In a subset of the
HMXBs, the compact objects accrete matter solely from winds of massive donor
stars. These so-called wind-fed HMXBs are divided in persistent HMXBs and
supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) according to their X-ray properties.
While it has been suggested that this dichotomy depends on the characteristics
of stellar winds, they have been poorly studied. With this investigation, we
aim to remedy this situation by systematically analyzing donor stars of
wind-fed HMXBs that are observable in the UV, concentrating on those with
neutron star (NS) companions. We obtained Swift X-ray data, HST UV spectra, and
additional optical spectra for all our targets. Our multi-wavelength approach
allows us to provide stellar and wind parameters for six donor stars (four
wind-fed systems and two OBe X-ray binaries). The wind properties are in line
with the predictions of the line-driven wind theory. Three of the donor stars
are in an advanced evolutionary stage, while for some of the stars, the
abundance pattern indicates that processed material might have been accreted.
When passing by the NS in its tight orbit, the donor star wind has not yet
reached its terminal velocity but it is still significantly slower; its speed
is comparable with the orbital velocity of the NS companion. There are no
systematic differences between the two types of wind-fed HMXBs (persistent
versus transients) with respect to the donor stars. For the SFXTs in our
sample, the orbital eccentricity is decisive for their transient X-ray nature.
Based on the orbital parameters and the further evolution of the donor stars,
the investigated HMXBs will presumably form Thorne-\.Zytkow objects in the
future.

the unusual band structure that can manifest by accumulating a nontrivial phase
in quantum oscillations. Here we report a study of the de Haasvan Alphen
oscillations of the candidate topological nodal line semimetal CaAgAs using
torque measurements in magnetic fields up to 45 T. Our results are compared
with calculations for a toroidal Fermi surface originating from the nodal ring.
We find evidence of a nontrivial Berry phase shift only in one of the
oscillatory frequencies. We interpret this as a Berry phase arising from the
semi-classical electronic Landau orbit which links with the nodal ring when the
magnetic field lies in the mirror (ab) plane. Furthermore, additional Berry
phase accumulates while rotating the magnetic field for the second orbit in the
same orientation which does not link with the nodal ring. These effects are
expected in CaAgAs due to the lack of inversion symmetry. Our study
experimentally demonstrates that CaAgAs is an ideal platform for exploring the
physics of nodal line semimetals and our approach can be extended to other
materials in which trivial and nontrivial oscillations are present.

existence of an additional series resistance associated with a channel at the

This resistance is responsible for both threshold switching characteristics,
and the memory effect, and the oxygen ion electromigration process is shown to
underlie this effect. Potential applications of the observed phenomena,

and aims to reflect enough of the literature to be representative of the
current state of the subject. To enhance clarity, the main findings are
presented in the form of a coherent synthesis of the reviewed sources. The
review highlights core characteristics of quantum mechanics. One is statistical
balance in the collective response of an ensemble of identically prepared
systems, to differing measurement types. Another is that states are
mathematical terms prescribing probability aspects of future events, relating
to an ensemble of systems, in various situations. These characteristics then
yield helpful insights on entanglement, measurement, and widely-discussed
experiments and analyses. The review concludes by considering how these
insights are supported, illustrated and developed by some specific approaches
to understanding quantum mechanics. The review uses non-mathematical language
precisely (terms defined) and rigorously (consistent meanings), and uses only
such language. A theory more descriptive of independent reality than is quantum
mechanics may yet be possible. One step in the pursuit of such a theory is to
reach greater consensus on how to understand quantum mechanics. This review
aims to contribute to achieving that greater consensus, and so to that pursuit.

  unidentified sources","  The $\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework predicts the existence of thousands
of subhalos in our own Galaxy not massive enough to retain baryons and become
visible. Yet, some of them may shine in gamma rays provided that the dark
matter (DM) is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), that would
self-annihilate and would appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources (unIDs) in
gamma-ray catalogs. Indeed, unIDs have proven to be competitive targets for DM
searches with gamma rays. In this work, we focus on the three high-latitude
($|b|\geq 10^\circ$) sources present in the 2HWC catalog of the High Altitude
Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory with no associations at other wavelenghts.
Indeed, only one of these sources, 2HWC J1040+308, is found to be above the
HAWC detection threshold when considering 760 days of data, a factor 1.5 more
exposure time than in the original 2HWC catalog. Other instruments such as
Fermi-LAT or VERITAS at lower energies do not detect this source. Also, this
unID is reported as spatially extended, making it even more interesting in a DM
search context. While waiting for more data that may shed further light on the
nature of this source, we set competitive upper limits on the annihilation
cross section by comparing this HAWC unID to expectations based on
state-of-the-art N-body cosmological simulations of the Galactic subhalo
population. We find these constraints to be particularly competitive for heavy
WIMPs, i.e., masses above $\sim 25$ (40) TeV in the case of the $b\bar{b}$
($\tau^+\tau^-$) annihilation channel, reaching velocity-averaged cross section
values of $2\cdot10^{-25}$ ($5\cdot10^{-25}$) $cm^3s^{-1}$. Although far from
the thermal relic cross section value, the obtained limits are independent and
nicely complementary to those from radically different DM analyses and targets,
demonstrating again the high potential of this DM search approach.

the source flux. This has been interpreted in a Comptonization scenario, where
an increase in the soft flux decreases the temperature of the corona, leading
to steepening of the photon index. However, the variation of the coronal
temperature with flux has been difficult to measure due to the presence of
complex reflection component in the hard X-rays and the lack of high-quality
data at that energy band. Recently, a 200 ks {\it NuSTAR} observation of Ark
564 in 3--50 keV band, revealed the presence of one of the coolest coronae with
temperature $kT_e \sim 15$ keV in the time-averaged spectrum. Here, we
re-analyse the data and examined the spectra in four flux levels. Our analysis
shows that the coronal temperature decreased from $\sim 17$ to $\sim 14$ keV as
the flux increased. The high energy photon index $\Gamma \sim 2.3$ varied by
less than $0.1$, implying that the optical depth of the corona increased by
about 10\% as the flux increased. This first reporting of coronal temperature
variation with flux shows that further long observation by {\it NuSTAR} of this

lane crossing the central starburst. Mrk 900 displays overall rotation,

gravitational perturbations of the companion planets. Due to their proximity to
the Sun, the angular separation between the host stars and the potentially
habitable planets in these two systems is 25 and 59 mas, respectively. They are
thus good candidates for future direct imaging by JWST and E-ELT. In addition
we find GJ 433 c, a cold super-Neptune belonging to an unexplored population of
Neptune-like planets. With a separation of 0.5 as from its host star, GJ 433 c
is probably the first realistic candidate for direct imaging of cold Neptunes.

formation.

numerically by two- and one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. When a
standing whistler wave collapses due to the wave breaking of ion plasma waves,
the energy of the electromagnetic waves transfers directly to the ion kinetic
energy. Here we find that the ion heating by the standing whistler wave is
operational even in multi-dimensional simulations of multi-ion species targets,
such as deuterium-tritium (DT) ices and solid ammonia borane (H$_6$BN). The
energy conversion efficiency to ions becomes as high as 15% of the injected
laser energy, which depends significantly on the target thickness and laser
pulse duration. The ion temperature could reach a few tens of keV or much
higher if appropriate laser-plasma conditions are selected. DT fusion plasmas
generated by this method must be useful as efficient neutron sources. Our
numerical simulations suggest that the neutron generation efficiency exceeds

presence of a strong magnetic field. We consider in particular, the so-called
Magnetic Dual Chiral Density Wave (MDCDW) phase, which is materialized by an
inhomogeneous condensate formed by a particle-hole pair. It is shown, that the
MDCDW phase is more stable in the weak-coupling regime than the one considered
in the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry braking phenomenon (MC$\chi$SB)
and even than the chiral symmetric phase that was expected to be realized at
sufficiently high baryonic chemical potential. The different components of the
photon polarization operator of the MDCDW phase in the one-loop approximation
are calculated. We found that in the MDCDW phase there is no Debye screening
neither Meissner effect in the lowest-Landau-level approximation. The obtained
Debye length depends on the amplitude $m$ and modulation $b$ of the
inhomogeneous condensate and it is only different from zero if the relation $|
\mu -b| > m$ holds. But, we found that in the region of interest this
inequality is not satisfied. Thus, no Debye screening takes place under those
conditions. On the other hand, since the particle-hole condensate is
electrically neutral, the U(1) electromagnetic group is not broken by the
ground state and consequently there is no Meissner effect. These results can be
of interest for the astrophysics of neutron stars.

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is a tedious task that, owing to the
large number of line blends, often leads to uncertainties on [Fe/H] exceeding
0.25dex. The CEMP stars increase in number with decreasing [Fe/H] and some of
these are known to be bona fide second generation halo stars. Hence, knowing
their [Fe/H] is important for tracing the formation and chemical evolution of
the Galaxy. Here, we aim to improve the [Fe/H] measurements in low-resolution
spectra by avoiding issues related to blends. We improve our chemical tagging
in such spectra at low metallicities. We developed an empirical way of deriving
[Fe/H] in CEMP (and C-normal) stars that relates the equivalent width (EW) of
strong lines, which remain detectable in lower-resolution, metal-poor spectra.
The best [Fe/H] tracers are found to be Cr I and Ni I, which both show strong
transitions in spectral regions that are free of molecular bands (between
~5200-6800A, a region accessible to most surveys). We derive different
relations for dwarfs and giants. The relations are valid in the ranges
~-3<[Fe/H]<-0.5 and 10<EW<800mA (Cr) or [Fe/H]>-3.2 and EW>5mA (Ni), depending
on the element and line as well as the stellar evolutionary stage. The
empirical relations are valid for both CEMP and C-normal stars and have been
proven to be accurate tracers in a sample of ~400 stars (mainly giants). The
metallicities are accurate to within ~0.2 depending on the sample and
resolution, and the empirical relations are robust to within 0.05-0.1dex. Our
relations will improve the metallicity determination in future surveys, which
will encounter a large number of CEMP stars, and will greatly speed up the
process of determining [Fe/H] as the EWs only need to be measured in two or
three lines in relatively clean regions compared to dealing with numerous
blended Fe lines. Abrigded.

the lower edge of the conformal window and their extension to the multiple
matter representations. In particular, we argue that the scheme-independent
series expansion for the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear at an
infrared fixed point, $\gamma_{\bar{\chi}\chi,\,{\rm IR}}$, combined with the
conjectured critical condition, $\gamma_{\bar{\chi}\chi,\,{\rm IR}} = 1$ or
equivalently $\gamma_{\bar{\chi}\chi,\,{\rm IR}}
(2-\gamma_{\bar{\chi}\chi,\,{\rm IR}})=1$, can be used to determine the
boundary of conformal phase transition on fully physical grounds. In
illustrative cases of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ theories with $N_R$ Dirac fermions in
various representations, we assess our results by comparing to other analytical
or lattice results.

2001.02691v1,2020-01-08,2020-01-08,Are ultra-diffuse galaxies Milky Way-sized?,"  Now almost 70 years since its introduction, the effective or half-light
radius has become a very popular choice for characterising galaxy size.
However, the effective radius measures the concentration of light within
galaxies and thus does not capture the intuitive definition of size which is
related to the edge or boundary of objects. For this reason, we aim to
demonstrate the undesirable consequence of using the effective radius to draw
conclusions about the nature of faint 'ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs) when
compared to dwarfs and Milky Way-like galaxies. Instead of the effective
radius, we use a measure of galaxy size based on the location of the gas
density threshold required for star formation. Compared to the effective
radius, this physically motivated definition places the sizes much closer to
the boundary of a galaxy. Therefore, considering the sizes and stellar mass
density profiles of UDGs and regular dwarfs, we find that the UDGs have sizes
that are within the size range of dwarfs. We also show that currently known
UDGs do not have sizes comparable to Milky Way-like objects. We find that, on
average, UDGs are ten times smaller in extension than Milky Way-like galaxies.
These results show that the use of size estimators sensitive to the
concentration of light can lead to misleading results.

  cluster NGC 330","  The multiplicity properties of massive stars are one of the important
outstanding issues in stellar evolution. Quantifying the binary statistics of
all evolutionary phases is essential to paint a complete picture of how and
when massive stars interact with their companions, and to determine the
consequences of these interactions. We investigate the multiplicity of an
almost complete census of red supergiant stars (RSGs) in NGC 330, a young
massive cluster in the SMC. Using a combination of multi-epoch HARPS and MUSE
spectroscopy, we estimate radial velocities and assess the kinematic and
multiplicity properties of 15 RSGs in NGC 330. Radial velocities are estimated
to better than +/-100 m/s for the HARPS data. The line-of-sight velocity
dispersion for the cluster is estimated as 3.20 +0.69-0.52 km/s. When virial
equilibrium is assumed, the dynamical mass of the cluster is log (M{dyn}
/M{sun}) = 5.20+/-0.17, in good agreement with previous upper limits. We detect
significant radial velocity variability in our multi-epoch observations and
distinguish between variations caused by atmospheric activity and those caused
by binarity. The binary fraction of NGC 330 RSGs is estimated by comparisons
with simulated observations of systems with a range of input binary fractions.
In this way, we account for observational biases and estimate the intrinsic
binary fraction for RSGs in NGC 330 as f{RSG} = 0.3+/-0.1 for orbital periods
in the range 2.3< log P [days] <4.3, with q>0.1. Using the distribution of the
luminosities of the RSG population, we estimate the age of NGC 330 to be 45+/-5
Myr and estimate a red straggler fraction of 50%. We estimate the binary
fraction of RSGs in NGC 330 and conclude that it appears to be lower than that
of main-sequence massive stars, which is expected because interactions between
an RSG and a companion are assumed to effectively strip the RSG envelope.

interacting stellar winds which may act as particle accelerators. Therefore,
such binaries are good candidates for detection at high energies. However, only
the massive binary Eta Carinae has been firmly associated with a gamma-ray
signal. A second system, gamma^2 Velorum, is positionally coincident with a
gamma-ray source, but unambiguous identification remains lacking. Aims.
Observing orbital modulation of the flux would establish an unambiguous
identification of the binary gamma^2 Velorum as the gamma-ray source detected
by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Methods. We have used more than
10 years of observations with Fermi-LAT. Events are folded with the orbital
period of the binary to search for variability. Systematic errors that might
arise from the strong emission of the nearby Vela pulsar are studied by
comparing with a more conservative pulse-gated analysis. Results. Hints of
orbital variability are found, indicating maximum flux from the binary during
apastron passage. Conclusions. Our analysis strengthens the possibility that
gamma-rays are produced in gamma^2 Velorum, most likely as a result of particle
acceleration in the wind collision region. The observed orbital variability is
consistent with predictions from recent MHD simulations, but contrasts with the
orbital variability from Eta Carinae, where the peak of the light curve is
found at periastron.

confirmed to preferentially align with parsec-scale jets in AGN with dominant

the disk-jet interpretation of the observed positional offsets. These results

perturbation theory predicts that second-order density inhomogeneities are a
convolution of a short- and a long-wavelength mode. This arises physically
because small scale structures grow at different rates depending on the large
scale environment in which they reside. This induces an off-diagonal term in
the two-point statistics in Fourier space that we use as the basis for a
quadratic estimator for the large scale field. We demonstrate that this
quadratic estimator works well on an N-body simulation of size (2.5 h^{-1}
Gpc)^3. In particular, the quadratic estimator successfully reconstructs the
long-wavelength modes using only small-scale information. This opens up novel
opportunities to study structure on the largest observable scales.

2001.02903v1,2020-01-09,2020-01-09,Thermodynamic properties of graphene bilayers,"  Thermodynamic properties of graphene bilayers are studied by path-integral
molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, considering quantization of vibrational
modes and anharmonic effects. Bilayer graphene has been studied at temperatures
between 12 and 1500~K for zero external stress, using the LCBOPII effective
potential. We concentrate on the thermal expansion, in-plane and out-of-plane
compressibility, and specific heat. Additional insight into the meaning of our
results for bilayer graphene is obtained from a comparison with data obtained
from PIMD simulations for monolayer graphene and graphite. They are also
analyzed in view of experimental data for graphite. Zero-point and thermal
effects on the in-plane and ""real"" area of bilayer graphene are studied. The
thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha_{xy}$ of the in-plane area is negative at
low temperatures and positive for $T \gtrsim$ 800~K. The minimum $\alpha_{xy}$
is $-6.6 \times 10^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ at $T \approx 220$~K. Both in-plane
($\chi_{xy}$) and out-of-plane ($\chi_z$) compressibilities of graphene
bilayers are found to increase for rising temperature, and turn out to be lower
than that corresponding to monolayer graphene and higher than those found for
graphite. At 300 K, we find for the bilayer $\chi_{xy} = 9.5 \times 10^{-2}$
\AA$^2$/eV and $\chi_z = 2.97 \times 10^{-2}$ GPa$^{-1}$. Results for the
specific heat obtained from the simulations are compared with those given by a
harmonic approximation for the vibrational modes. This approach is noticeably
accurate at temperatures lower than 200~K.

  Quantum Cosmology","  We provide an analytical solution to the quantum dynamics of a flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre- Robertson-Walker model with a massless scalar field in
the presence of a small and positive cosmological constant, in the context of
Loop Quantum Cosmology. We use a perturbative treatment with respect to the
model without a cosmological constant, which is exactly solvable. Our solution
is approximate, but it is precisely valid at the high curvature regime where
quantum gravity corrections are important. We compute explicitly the evolution
of the expectation value of the volume. For semiclassical states characterized
by a Gaussian spectral profile, the introduction of a positive cosmological
constant displaces the bounce of the solvable model to lower volumes and to
higher values of the scalar field. These displacements are state dependent, and
in particular, they depend on the peak of the Gaussian profile, which measures
the momentum of the scalar field. Moreover, for those semiclassical states, the
bounce remains symmetric, as in the vanishing cosmological constant case.
However, we show that the behavior of the volume is more intricate for generic
states, leading in general to a non-symmetric bounce.

2001.02919v1,2020-01-09,2020-01-09,Influence of vacancy defects in solid high-order harmonic generation,"  The present work discusses the impact of vacancy defects in solid high-order
harmonic generation. The total energy cutoff of the high-order harmonic
spectrum increases as a function of concentration of vacancy defects, and the
total spectrum gradually turns into a single slanted spectrum without having an
abrupt transition between primary and secondary plateaus. The spectral
intensity of the below-band-gap harmonics in a solid with vacancy defects is
enhanced significantly in comparison to the harmonics in a pristine solid. The
changes in the harmonic spectra are understood in terms of their effective band
structures. The presence of vacancy defects breaks the translational symmetry
of the unit cell locally. As a consequence of this, new defect states appear,
which open additional paths for the electron dynamics. The ill-resolved
electron trajectories in the Gabor profile confirm the interference of
additional paths. Moreover, the single slanted high-order harmonic spectrum
carries a unique signature of vacancy defects in comparison to the high-order
harmonic spectrum corresponding to solids with defects such as underdoping or
overdoping.

optically classified with the Palomar data as not presenting a broad component
in the Balmer emission lines associated to the Broad Line Region (BLR) of the
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We unveil the presence of different kinematic
components of emission lines in the nuclear region of a sample of local
(z$\leq$0.022) type-2 LINERs. We focus on the analysis of their true nature by
means of the detection (or not) of a broad component originated in the BLR.
Additionally, we search for the possible presence of non-rotational motions
such as outflows. We have applied a decomposition of the nuclear emission lines
using a spectroscopic analysis of the optical spectra of 9 type-2 LINERs of
intermediate-resolution data retrieved from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
archive. The study is completed with archival spectra from the Double
Spectrograph from the Palomar Observatory. The emission line fitting reveals
the presence of a broad component associated to the BLR in 6 out of the 9
galaxies for the space-based data, and for 2 out of the 8 from the ground-based
spectra. The velocity dispersion of two galaxies (NGC 4486 and NGC 4594)
measured in HST/STIS data suggest the presence of outflows. The results
indicate that the spatial resolution plays a major role in the detection of the
BLR, as it appears diluted in the ground-based data (even after removing
stellar contribution). This is also true for the emission line diagnostics, as
the contaminant light contributes to lower emission line ratios towards the
star-forming area of standard BPTs. We propose to reclassify NGC4594 as a
type-1 LINER, since a BLR component is seen in both space- and ground-based
spectra. We find ambiguous results for the BLR component of NGC 4486. The
modest outflow detection in our sample may indicate that they are not as
frequent as for type-1 LINERs.

the shadows of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) as standard

a redshift range which would otherwise be challenging to access. In this note,
we critically examine this proposal, and identify a number of important issues
which had been previously overlooked. These include difficulties in obtaining
reliable SMBH mass estimates and reaching the required angular resolution, and
an insufficient knowledge of the accretion dynamics of high-redshift SMBHs.
While these issues currently appear to prevent high-redshift SMBH shadows from
being used as robust standard rulers, we hope that our flagging them early will
help in making this probe theoretically mature by the time it will be
experimentally feasible.

performance issues in computing systems due to the use of certain hardware
techniques to improve performance. Altering the access patterns to increase
locality can dramatically increase performance of a given algorithm. Besides,
repeated data access can be seen as redundancy in data movement. Similarly,
there can also be redundancy in the repetition of calculations. This work also
identifies some of the opportunities for avoiding these redundancies by
directly reusing computation results. We start by motivating why and how a more
efficient implementation can be achieved by exploiting reuse in the memory
hierarchy of modern instruction set processors. Next we document the
possibilities of such reuse in some selected machine learning algorithms.

subsequent mode is characterized by the relaxation of a metastable system to a

function the anisotropy field and the Gilbert damping are extracted over a
range of temperatures. The anisotropy exhibits a power-law dependence with
temperature with exponent $n\approx2.1$. This agrees well with what observed
experimentally and it is obtained without including a two-ion anisotropy term
as in other approaches. Our work shows that incorporating longitudinal
fluctuations into spin dynamics calculations is crucial for understanding the
properties of materials with induced moments.

(XSL), which contains all the spectra obtained over the six semesters of that
program. This release supersedes our first data release from Chen et al. 2014,
with a larger number of spectra (813 observations of 666 stars) and with a more
extended wavelength coverage as the data from the near-infrared arm of the
X-Shooter spectrograph are now included. The DR2 spectra then consist of three
segments that were observed simultaneously and, if combined, cover the range
between $\sim$300 nm and $\sim$2.45 $\mu$m at a spectral resolving power close
to $R=10\,000$. The spectra were corrected for instrument transmission and
telluric absorption, and they were also corrected for wavelength-dependent
flux-losses in 85% of the cases. On average, synthesized broad-band colors
agree with those of the MILES library and of the combined IRTF and Extended
IRTF libraries to within $\sim\!1$%. The scatter in these comparisons indicates
typical errors on individual colors in the XSL of 2$-$4 %. The comparison with
2MASS point source photometry shows systematics of up to 5% in some colors,
which we attribute mostly to zero-point or transmission curve errors and a
scatter that is consistent with the above uncertainty estimates. The final
spectra were corrected for radial velocity and are provided in the rest-frame
(with wavelengths in air). The spectra cover a large range of spectral types
and chemical compositions (with an emphasis on the red giant branch), which
makes this library an asset when creating stellar population synthesis models
or for the validation of near-ultraviolet to near-infrared theoretical stellar
spectra across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

density) profiles of elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges, and possibly for
dwarf spheroidal galaxies and globular clusters. The deprojected density and
mass profiles are important for many astrophysical applications, in particular
for mass-orbit modeling of these systems. However, the exact deprojection
formula for the S\'ersic model employs special functions not available in most
computer languages. We show that all previous analytical approximations to the
3D density profile are imprecise at low S\'ersic index ($n \lesssim 1.5$). We
have derived a more precise analytical approximation to the deprojected
S\'ersic density profile by fitting two-dimensional 10th-order polynomials to
the differences of the logarithms of the numerical deprojection and of the
analytical approximation by Lima Neto et al. (1999, LGM) of the density profile
on one hand and of the mass profile on the other. Our LGM-based polynomial fits
have typical relative precision better than $0.2\%$ for both density and mass
profiles, for S\'ersic indices $0.5 \leq n \leq 10$ and radii $0.001 < r/R_{\rm

perpendicularly to the stack of iron (15 mm) and polysiloxane scintillator (15

of the detector. The detector was tested with electrons, pions and muons with

providing an event-by-event measurement of high-angle decay products associated

local ($z \leq 0.25$) dwarf galaxies ($M_\mathrm{*} \leq 3 \times 10^9
\mathrm{M_\odot}$). We define a parent sample of 4,331 dwarf galaxies found
within the footprint of both the MPA-JHU galaxy catalogue (based on SDSS DR8)
and 3XMM DR7, performed a careful review of the data to remove
misidentifications and produced a sample of 61 dwarf galaxies that exhibit
nuclear X-ray activity indicative of an AGN. We examine the optical emission
line ratios of our X-ray selected sample and find that optical AGN diagnostics
fail to identify 85% of the sources. We then calculated the growth rates of the
black holes powering our AGN in terms of their specific accretion rates
($\propto L_\mathrm{X}/M_\mathrm{*}$, an approximate tracer of the Eddington
ratio). Within our observed sample, we found a wide range of specific accretion
rates. After correcting the observed sample for the varying sensitivity of
3XMM, we found further evidence for a wide range of X-ray luminosities and
specific accretion rates, described by a power law. Using this corrected AGN
sample we also define an AGN fraction describing their relative incidence
within the parent sample. We found the AGN fraction increases with host galaxy
mass (up to $\approx$ 6%) for galaxies with X-ray luminosities between $10^{39}
\mathrm{erg/s}$ and $10^{42} \mathrm{erg/s}$, and by extrapolating the power
law to higher luminosities, we found evidence to suggest the fraction of

$z \approx 0.7$.

model for the Universe, suggested previously by the authors within the context
of a string-inspired effective theory in the presence of a Kalb-Ramond (KR)
gravitational axion field which descends from the antisymmetric tensor of the
massless gravitational string multiplet. In the presence of this field, which
has anomalous CP violating interactions with the gravitons, primordial
gravitational waves induce gravitational anomalies, which in turn are
responsible for the appearance of $H^2$ and $H^4$ contributions to the vacuum
energy density, these terms being characteristic of generic
""running-vacuum-model (RVM) type"", where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. In this
work we prove in detail the appearance of the $H^4$ terms due to
gravitational-anomaly-induced condensates in the energy density of the
primordial Universe, which can self-consistently induce inflation, and
subsequent exit from it, according to the generic features of RVM. We also
argue in favour of the robustness of our results, which were derived within an
effective low-energy field theory approach, against Ultra Violet completion of
the theory. During the radiation and matter-dominated eras, gravitational
anomalies cancel, as required for the consistency of the quantum
matter/radiation field theory. However, chiral and QCD-axion-type anomalies
survive and have important consequences for both cosmic magnetogenesis and
axionic dark matter in the Universe. Finally, the stringy RVM scenario
presented here predicts quintessence-like dynamical dark energy for the current
Universe, which is compatible with the existing fitting analyses of such model
against observations

by a sampling scheme which is quite general, and which allows for the efficient
estimation of averages of a large class of observables. The competing
corrections to scaling for the hydrodynamic radius are clearly discernible. We
also find improved estimates for other universal properties that measure the
chain dimension. In particular, a method of analysis which eliminates the

often only calculated for a limited number of signal levels, CTI is calculated
from a limited number of pixels, and the sources of CTI are usually assumed to
occur at every pixel-to-pixel transfer. A number of serial CTI effects have
been identified during preliminary testing of CCDs developed by Imaging
Technology Laboratory (ITL) for use in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) camera focal plane that motivate additional study beyond the traditional
CTI characterization. This study describes a more detailed examination of the
serial deferred charge effects in order to fully characterize the deferred
charge measured in the serial overscan pixels of these sensors. The results
indicate that in addition to proportional CTI loss that occurs at each pixel
transfer, ITL CCDs have additional contributions to the deferred charge
measured in serial overscan pixels, likely caused by fixed CTI loss due to
charge trapping, and an electronic offset drift at high signal.

  for a large-scale neutrinoless double-beta decay search","  A high-pressure xenon gas time projection chamber, with a unique cellular
readout structure based on electroluminescence, has been developed for a
large-scale neutrinoless double-beta decay search. In order to evaluate the
detector performance and validate its design, a 180~L size prototype is being
constructed and its commissioning with partial detector has been performed. The
obtained energy resolution at 4.0~bar is 1.73 $\pm$ 0.07% (FWHM) at 511 keV.
The energy resolution at the $^{136}$Xe neutrinoless double-beta decay Q-value
is estimated to be between 0.79 and 1.52% (FWHM) by extrapolation.
Reconstructed event topologies show patterns peculiar to track end-point which
can be used to distinguish $0\nu\beta\beta$ signals from gamma-ray backgrounds.

demonstrate that the non-perturbative dynamical effects of the attractive

2001.03315v1,2020-01-10,2020-01-10,"Atomic carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen forbidden emission lines in the
  water-poor comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS)","  The N$_2$ and CO-rich and water-depleted comet C/2016 R2 (Pan-STARRS)
(hereafter `C/2016 R2') is a unique comet for detailed spectroscopic analysis.
We aim to explore the associated photochemistry of parent species, which
produces different metastable states and forbidden emissions, in this cometary
coma of peculiar composition. We re-analyzed the high-resolution spectra of
comet C/2016 R2, which were obtained in February 2018, using the UVES
spectrograph of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope
(VLT). Various forbidden atomic emission lines of [CI], [NI], and [OI] were
observed in the optical spectrum of this comet when it was at 2.8 au from the
Sun. The observed forbidden emission intensity ratios are studied in the
framework of a couple-chemistry emission model. The model calculations show
that CO$_2$ is the major source of both atomic oxygen green and red-doublet
emissions in the coma of C/2016 R2 (while for most comets it is generally
H$_2$O), whereas, CO and N$_2$ govern the atomic carbon and nitrogen emissions,
respectively. Our modelled oxygen green to red-doublet and carbon to nitrogen
emission ratios are higher by a factor {of 3}, when compared to the
observations. These discrepancies can be due to uncertainties associated with
photon cross sections or unknown production/loss sources. Our modelled oxygen
green to red-doublet emission ratio is close to the observations, when we
consider an O$_2$ abundance with a production rate of 30\% relative to the CO
production rate. The collisional quenching is not a significant loss process
for N($^2$D) though its radiative lifetime is significant ($\sim$10 hrs).
Hence, the observed [NI] doublet-emission ratio ([NI] 5198/5200) of 1.22, which
is smaller than the terrestrial measurement by a factor {1.4}, is mainly due to
the characteristic radiative decay of N($^2$D).

insured person (healthy, ill, or dead) and claims are connected in a Markov
chain is investigated. The signed compound Poisson approximation is applied to
the aggregate claims distribution after $n\in \mathbb {N}$ periods. The
accuracy of order $O(n^{-1})$ and $O(n^{-1/2})$ is obtained for the local and
uniform norms, respectively. In a particular case, the accuracy of estimates in
total variation and non-uniform estimates are shown to be at least of order
$O(n^{-1})$. The characteristic function method is used. The results can be
applied to estimate the probable loss of an insurer to optimize an insurance
premium.

  degenerate plasmas","  The nonlinear interaction of intense linearly polarized electromagnetic waves
(EMWs) with longitudinal electron density perturbations is revisited in
relativistic degenerate plasmas. The nonlinear dynamics of the EMWs and the
longitudinal field, driven by the EMW ponderomotive force, is governed by a
coupled set of nonlinear partial differential equations. A numerical simulation
of these coupled equations reveals that the generation of wakefields is
possible in weakly relativistic degenerate plasmas with $R_0\equiv p_F/mc\ll1$
and $v_g/c\sim1$, where $p_F$ is the Fermi momentum, $m$ is the mass of
electrons, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, and $v_g$ is the EMW group
velocity. However, when the ratio $v_g/c$ is reduced to $\sim0.1$, the
wakefield generation is suppressed, instead the longitudinal fields get
localized to form soliton-like structures. On the other hand, in the regimes of
moderate $(R_0\lesssim1)$ or strong relativistic degeneracy $(R_0>1)$ with
$v_g/c\sim0.1$, only the EM solitons can be formed.

fields in the interior of neutron stars plays a key role in the explanation of
the observed phenomenology. Understanding the transfer of energy between
toroidal and poloidal components, or between different scales, is of particular
relevance. In this letter, we present the first 3D simulations of the Hall
instability in a neutron star crust, confirming its existence for typical
magnetar conditions. We confront our results to estimates obtained by a linear
perturbation analysis, which discards any interpretation as numerical
instabilities and confirms its physical origin. Interestingly, the Hall
instability creates locally strong magnetic structures that occasionally can
make the crust yield to the magnetic stresses and generates coronal loops,
similarly as solar coronal loops find their way out through the photosphere.
This supports the viability of the mechanism, which has been proposed to
explain magnetar outbursts.

Integrating the SOTs into a scanning probe microscope allowed us to image the
stray field of a single Fe$_3$O$_4$ nanocube at 300 mK. Our results show that
the easy magnetization axis direction undergoes a transition from the (111)

attributed to the Verwey phase transition in Fe$_3$O$_4$.

For these galaxies, the average and median values of $Q$ seem to favor MG

continuously changing user requirements and dynamic markets, companies need to
build robust workflows that allow them to increase their agility in order to
remain competitive. This increasingly rapid transformation, especially in
domains like IoT or Cloud computing, poses significant challenges to guarantee
high quality software, since dynamism and agile short-term planning reduce the
ability to detect and manage risks. In this paper, we describe the main
challenges related to managing risk in agile software development, building on
the experience of more than 20 agile coaches operating continuously for 15
years with hundreds of teams in industries in all sectors. We also propose a
framework to manage risks that considers those challenges and supports
collaboration, agility, and continuous development. An implementation of that
framework is then described in a tool that handles risks and mitigation actions
associated with the development of multi-cloud applications. The methodology
and the tool have been validated by a team of evaluators that were asked to
consider its use in developing an urban smart mobility service and an airline

2001.03367v1,2020-01-10,2020-01-10,A Complex Networks Approach to Find Latent Clusters of Terrorist Groups,"  Given the extreme heterogeneity of actors and groups participating in
terrorist actions, investigating and assessing their characteristics can be
important to extract relevant information and enhance the knowledge on their
behaviors. The present work will seek to achieve this goal via a complex
networks approach. This approach will allow finding latent clusters of similar
terror groups using information on their operational characteristics.
Specifically, using open access data of terrorist attacks occurred worldwide
from 1997 to 2016, we build a multi-partite network that includes terrorist
groups and related information on tactics, weapons, targets, active regions. We
propose a novel algorithm for cluster formation that expands our earlier work
that solely used Gower's coefficient of similarity via the application of Von
Neumann entropy for mode-weighting. This novel approach is compared with our
previous Gower-based method and a heuristic clustering technique that only
focuses on groups' ideologies. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the
entropy-based approach tends to reliably reflect the structure of the data that
naturally emerges from the baseline Gower-based method. Additionally, it
provides interesting results in terms of behavioral and ideological
characteristics of terrorist groups. We furthermore show that the
ideology-based procedure tends to distort or hide existing patterns. Among the
main statistical results, our work reveals that groups belonging to opposite
ideologies can share very common behaviors and that Islamist/jihadist groups
hold peculiar behavioral characteristics with respect to the others.
Limitations and potential work directions are also discussed, introducing the
idea of a dynamic entropy-based framework.

  $z\sim$2-3: orientation and/or evolution?","  Core-extremely red quasars (core-ERQ) have been proposed to represent an
intermediate evolutionary phase in which a heavily obscured quasar is blowing
out the circumnuclear interstellar medium with very energetic outflows prior to
becoming an optical quasar. We revise the general UV and optical emission line
properties of core-ERQ in the context of the AGN orientation-based unification
scenario. We use diagnostic diagrams based on ultraviolet (UV) emission line
ratios and UV-optical line kinematic information to compare the physical and
kinematic gas properties of core-ERQ with those of other luminous narrow and
broad line AGN. In particular, we provide a revised comparison of the [OIII]
kinematics in 21 core-ERQ with other samples of quasars matched in luminosity
with the aim of evaluating whether core-ERQ host the most extreme [OIII]
outflows.
  The UV line ratios suggest that the physical properties (for instance,
density, metallicity) of the ionised gas in core-ERQ are similar to those
observed in the BLR of blue Nitrogen-loud QSOs. The [OIII] outflow velocities
of core-ERQ are, on average, consistent with those of very luminous blue QSO1,
although extreme outflows are much more frequent in core-ERQ. These
similarities can be explained in the context of the AGN unification model,
assuming that core-ERQ are viewed with an intermediate orientation between type
2 (edge-on) and type 1 (face-on) QSOs. We propose that core-ERQ are very
luminous but otherwise normal quasars viewed at an intermediate orientation.
Such orientation allows a direct view of the outer part of the large BLR, from
which core-ERQ UV emission originates; the extreme [OIII] outflow velocities
are instead a consequence of the very high luminosity of core-ERQ.

uniformly accelerated sender in the right Rindler wedge, a conformal receiver

observer interacts unitarily with the Rindler modes of the field, thereby
accessing entanglement of the vacuum as a resource. We find that a
Rindler-displaced Minkowski vacuum state prepared and teleported by the
accelerated observer appears mixed according to the inertial observer, despite
a reduction of the quadrature variances below classical limits. This is a
surprising result, since the same state transmitted directly from the
accelerated observer appears as a pure coherent state to the inertial observer.
The decoherence of the state is caused by an interplay of opposing effects as
the acceleration increases: the reduction of vacuum noise in the output state
for a stronger entanglement resource, constrained by the amplification of
thermal noise due to the presence of Unruh radiation.

cluster (GC) 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc). This work was undertaken within the GC
sub-project of the Transient UV Objects project, a programme which aims to find
and study transient and strongly variable UV sources. Globular clusters are
ideal targets for transient searches because of their high stellar densities
and large populations of variable systems. Using all archival observations of
47 Tuc obtained with the UV/optical telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels
Swift observatory with the uvm2 filter, we searched for UV variability using a
specialised pipeline which utilises difference image analysis. We found four
clear transients, hereafter SW1-4, with positions consistent with those of
known cataclysmic variables (CVs) or CV candidates identified previously using
Hubble Space Telescope observations. All four sources exhibit significant
outbursts. Based on the inferred outburst properties and the association with
known CVs, we tentatively identify the UV transients as CV-dwarf novae (DNe).
Two DNe have been previously observed in 47 Tuc: V2, which has a position
consistent with that of SW4; and AKO 9, which was not in outburst during any of
the UVOT observations. We thus increase the known number of DNe in 47 Tuc to 5
and the total number of detected DNe in all Galactic GCs combined from 14 to
17. We discuss our results in the context of the apparent scarcity of DNe in
GCs. We suggest that the likely cause is observational biases, such as limited
sensitivity due to the high background from unresolved stars in the GC and
limited angular resolution of the telescopes used. We additionally detected one
strongly variable source in 47 Tuc, which could be identified as the known RR
Lyrae star HV 810. We found its period to have significantly increased with

help state transformation. In this paper, we consider the problem of
catalyst-assisted probabilistic coherence distillation for mixed states under
strictly incoherent operations. To this end, we first present the necessary and
sufficient conditions for distilling a target pure coherent state from an
initial mixed state via stochastic strictly incoherent operations and the
maximal probability of obtaining the target pure state from the initial state.
With the help of these results, we present the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the existence of a catalyst that increases the maximal
transformation probability.

sulfonated methyl esters (SME), sodium salts. The zwitterionic
dodecyldimethylamine oxide (DDAO) has been used as a cosurfactant. As
representatives of the vegetable and mineral oils, sunflower seed oil and light

excellent cleaning of oil is achieved by mixed solutions of SME and DDAO. In
the case of stainless steel, excellent cleaning (superior than that by linear
alkylbenzene sulfonate and sodium lauryl ether sulfate) is provided by binary
and ternary mixtures of SMEs, which may contain also DDAO. For the studied
systems, the good cleaning correlates neither with the oil/water interfacial

that governing factors might be the thickness and morphology of admicelle

been extensively applied following reactor accidents and also would provide a
key tool for response to a malicious radiological or nuclear incident. Methods
exist to calibrate the aerial survey system for quantification of the
concentration of natural radionuclides, which can provide guidance. However,
these methods have anticipated a spatial distribution of the source which is
large in comparison to the survey altitude. In rapid emergency-response aerial
surveys of areas of safety concern, deposits of relatively small spatial extent
may be expected. The activity of such spatially restricted hot spots is
underestimated using the traditional methods. We present here a spatial
deconvolution method which can recover some of the variation smoothed out by
the averaging due to survey at altitude. We show that the method can recover
the true spatial distribution of concentration of a synthetic source. We then
apply the method to real aerial survey data collected following detonation of a
radiological dispersal device. The findings and implications of the
deconvolution are then discussed by reference to a groundbased truckborne

  Continuum- Molecular Dynamics Approach","  Accurate calculation of the ion-ion recombination rate coefficient has been
of long-standing interest, as it controls the ion concentration in gas phase
systems and in aerosols. We describe the development of a hybrid
continuum-molecular dynamics approach to determine the ion-ion recombination
rate coefficient. The approach is based on the limiting sphere method
classically used for transition regime collision phenomena in aerosols. When
ions are sufficiently far from one another, ion-ion relative motion is
described by diffusion equations while within a critical distance, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are used to model ion-ion motion. MD simulations are
parameterized using the AMBER force-field as well as by considering partial
charges on atoms. Ion-neutral gas collisions are modeled in two mutually
exclusive cubic domains composed of 103 gas atoms each, which remain centered
on the recombining ions throughout calculations. Example calculations are
reported for NH4+ recombination with NO2- in He, across a pressure range from
10 kPa to 10,000 kPa. Excellent agreement is found in comparison of
calculations to literature values for the 100 kPa recombination rate
coefficient (1.0 x 10-12 m3 s-1) in He. We also recover the experimentally
observed increase in recombination rate coefficient with pressure at
sub-atmospheric pressures, and the observed decrease in recombination rate
coefficient in the high pressure continuum limit. We additionally find that
non-dimensionalized forms of rate coefficients are consistent with recently
developed equations for the dimensionless charged particle-ion collision rate
coefficient based on Langevin dynamics simulations.

Methods: We studied the kinematics of \textit{Gaia} DR2 sources with parallax
values between 1/60 and 1/30 milliarcseconds towards two regions that show
abnormally high values of extinction and reddening; the results are compared
with predictions from GALAXIA Galactic model. We also plotted the

the parallaxes, and studied the effects of the large parallax errors by Monte
Carlo sampling. Results: The kinematics point towards a Galactic origin for one
of the regions, while the provenance of the stars in the other is not clear. A
spectroscopic analysis of some of the sources in the first region confirms that
they are located in the halo. The CM diagram of the sources suggests that some
of them are young.

currently being debated. The direct detection of the neutron star merger
GW170817, through gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, has
confirmed such events as important sources of the $r$-process elements.
However, chemical evolution models are not able to reproduce the observed
chemical abundances in the Milky Way when neutron star mergers are assumed to
be the only $r$-process site and realistic time distributions of such events
are taken into account. Now for the first time, we combine all the available
observational evidence of the Milky Way and its dwarf galaxy satellites to show
that the data can only be explained if there are (at least) two distinct
$r$-process sites: a quick source with timescales comparable to core-collapse
supernovae, $t_{quick}\lesssim10^8$ yr, and a delayed source with
characteristic timescales $t_{delayed}\gtrsim4$ Gyr. The delayed $r$-process
source most probably originates in neutron star mergers, as the timescale fits
well with that estimated for GW170817. Given the short timescales of the quick
source, it is likely associated with massive stars, though a specific
fast-track channel for compact object mergers cannot be excluded at this point.
Our approach demonstrates that only by looking at all the available data will
we be able to solve the puzzle that is the $r$-process.

IR source with $S_{500}$~120mJy (Red Virgo 4 - RV4). Based on IRAM/EMIR and
IRAM/NOEMA detections of the CO(5-4), CO(4-3), and [CI] lines, RV4 is located
at z=4.724, yielding a total observed L$_{IR}$ of
1.1+/-0.6x0$^{14}$L$_{\odot}$. At the position of the Herschel emission, three
blobs are detected with the VLA at 10cm. The CO(5-4) line detection of each
blob confirms that they are at the same redshift with the same line width,
indicating that they are multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and
deep optical observations, two sources, High-z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1 East,
are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs. These two sources are
placed at z=1.48 with XSHOOTER spectra, suggesting that they could be merging
and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant
lens known to date in strong lensing systems. The Einstein radius of the
lensing system is 2.2""+/-0.2 (20kpc). The high redshift of HL1 and the large
Einstein radius are highly unusual for a strong lensing system. We present the
ISM properties of the background source RV4. Different estimates of the gas
depletion time yield low values suggesting that RV4 is a SB galaxy. Among all
high-z SMGs, this source exhibits one of the lowest L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{IR}$
ratios, 3.2+/-0.9x10$^{-6}$, suggesting an extremely short gas tdepl of only
14+/-5Myr. It also shows a relatively high L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{CO(4-3)}$ ratio
(0.7+/-0.2) and low L$_{CO(5-4)}$ to L$_{IR}$ ratio (only ~50% of the value
expected for normal galaxies) hinting a low density of gas. Finally, we discuss
that the short tdepl of RV4 can be explained by either a very high SFE, which
is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or
a rapid decrease of SF, which would bias the estimate of tdepl toward low
value.

how the coupling to the environment affects the two characteristic properties
of a protective measurement, namely, (i) the ability to leave the state of the
system approximately unchanged and (ii) the transfer of information about
expectation values to the apparatus pointer. We find that even when the
interaction with the environment is weak enough not to lead to appreciable
decoherence of the initial qubit state, it causes a significant broadening of
the probability distribution for the position of the apparatus pointer at the
conclusion of the measurement. This washing out of the pointer position
crucially diminishes the accuracy with which the desired expectation values can
be measured from a readout of the pointer. We additionally show that even when
the coupling to the environment is chosen such that the state of the system is
immune to decoherence, the environment may still detrimentally affect the
pointer readout.

thermochemical equilibrium. We aim to provide disequilibrium chemistry maps for
a global understanding of the chemistry in HAT-P-7b's atmosphere and assess the
importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.
  We apply a hierarchical modelling approach utilising 97 1D atmospheric
profiles from 3D GCM of HAT-P-7b. For each 1D profile, we evaluate our kinetic
cloud formation model consistently with the local gas-phase composition in
chemical equilibrium. We then evaluate quenching results from a zeroth-order
approximation in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase approach.
  We find that the zeroth-order approach of estimating quenching points agrees
well with the full gas-kinetic modeling results. Chemical disequilibrium has
the greatest effect on the nightside and morning abundance of species such as
H, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all C$_n$H$_m$ molecules; heavier
C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by disequilibrium processes. CO
abundance, however, is affected only marginally. While dayside abundances also
notably change, those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b are the least
affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may partially explain
the consistency of observed transmission spectra of UHJs with atmospheres in
thermochemical equilibrium. Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular
abundances and quenching levels.
  In general, the quenching points of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere are at much lower
pressures in comparison to the cooler hot-jupiters. We propose several avenues
to look for the effect of disequilibrium processes on UHJs that are, in
general, based on abundance and opacity measurements at different local times.
It remains a challenge to completely disentangle this from the chemical effects

molecular junctions, open nonequilibrium quantum systems, under external
periodic driving. Periodic driving is described using the Floquet theory

Light-matter interaction is modeled employing the self-consistent Born

2001.06292v1,2020-01-10,2020-01-10,Magnets in an electric field: hidden forces and momentum conservation,"  In 1967 Shockley and James addressed the situation of a magnet in an electric
field. The magnet is at rest and contains electromagnetic momentum, but there
was no obvious mechanical momentum to balance this for momentum conservation.
They concluded that some sort of mechanical momentum, which they called ""hidden
momentum"", was contained in the magnet and ascribed this momentum to
relativistic effects, a contention that was apparently confirmed by Coleman and
Van Vleck. Since then, a magnetic dipole in an electric field has been
considered to have this new form of momentum, but this view ignores the
electromagnetic forces that arise when an electric field is applied to a magnet
or a magnet is formed in an electric field. The electromagnetic forces result
in the magnet gaining electromagnetic momentum and an equal and opposite amount
of mechanical momentum so that it is moving in its original rest frame. This
moving reference frame is erroneously taken to be the rest frame in studies
that purport to show hidden momentum. Here I examine the analysis of Shockley
and James and of Coleman and Van Vleck and consider a model of a magnetic
dipole formed in a uniform electric field. These calculations show no hidden
momentum.

transportation science, spatial economics, sociology and many other fields. For
more than 100 years, many human mobility prediction models have been proposed,
among which the gravity model analogous to Newton's law of gravitation is
widely used. Another classical model is the intervening opportunity (IO) model,
which indicates that an individual selecting a destination is related to both
the destination's opportunities and the intervening opportunities between the
origin and the destination. The IO model established from the perspective of
individual selection behavior has recently triggered the establishment of many
new IO class models. Although these IO class models can achieve accurate
prediction at specific spatiotemporal scales, an IO class model that can
describe an individual's destination selection behavior at different
spatiotemporal scales is still lacking. Here, we develop a universal
opportunity model that considers two human behavioral tendencies: one is the
exploratory tendency, and the other is the cautious tendency. Our model
establishes a new framework in IO class models and covers the classical
radiation model and opportunity priority selection model. Furthermore, we use
various mobility data to demonstrate our model's predictive ability. The
results show that our model can better predict human mobility than previous IO
class models. Moreover, this model can help us better understand the underlying
mechanism of the individual's destination selection behavior in different types
of human mobility.

assumed spherical Wigner-Seitz cells in the inner crust, to admit the
possibility of pasta phases, i.e., non-spherical cell shapes. Full fourth-order
extended Thomas-Fermi calculations using the density functional BSk24 are
performed for cylindrical and plate-like cells. Unlike in our spherical-cell
calculations, we do not include shell and pairing corrections, but there are
grounds for expecting these corrections for pasta to be significantly smaller.
It is therefore meaningful to compare the ETF pasta results with the full
spherical-cell results, i.e., with shell and pairing corrections included.
However, in view of the many previous studies in which shell and pairing
corrections were omitted entirely, it is of interest to compare our pasta
results with the ETF part of the corresponding spherical calculations. Making
this latter comparison we find that as the density increases the cell shapes
pass through the usual sequence sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ plate before the
transition to the homogeneous core. The filling fractions found at the phase
transitions are in close agreement with expectations based on the liquid-drop
model. On the other hand, when we compare with the full spherical-cell results,
we find the sequence to be sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ sphere $\to$ cylinder
$\to$ plate. In neither case do any ""inverted"", i.e., bubble-like,
configurations appear. We provide accurate fitting formulas to all our
essential numerical results for each of the three phases, designed especially

one to capture not only the general behavior of the fitted functions, but also
the differences between them in different phases.

demanding. For optimal performance, an amount of computation that increases at
an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the data rate of

2001.04019v2,2020-01-13,2020-01-13,Tribimaximal Mixing in the $SU(5) \times \mathcal{T}_{13}$ Texture,"  We extend the recently proposed $SU(5) \times \mathcal{T}_{13}$ model for the
asymmetric texture to the up-type quark and seesaw sectors. The hierarchical
up-type quark masses are generated from higher-dimensional operators involving
family-singlet Higgses, gauge-singlet familons, and vectorlike messengers. The
complex-tribimaximal (TBM) seesaw mixing arises from the vacuum structure of a
minimal number of familons, resulting in an alignment between the Yukawa and
Majorana matrices of the seesaw formula. Introducing four right-handed
neutrinos, normal ordering of the light neutrino masses is obtained, with
$m_{\nu_1} = 27.6\ \mathrm{meV}$, $m_{\nu_2} = 28.9\ \mathrm{meV}$ and
$m_{\nu_3} = 57.8\ \mathrm{meV}$. Their sum almost saturates Planck's
cosmological upper bound ($120$ $\text{meV}$). The right-handed neutrino masses
are expressed in terms of two parameters for a particular choice of familon
vacuum alignment. We predict the $\require{cancel}\cancel{CP}$
Jarlskog-Greenberg invariant to be $|\mathcal{J}| = 0.028$, consistent with the
current PDG estimate, and Majorana invariants $|\mathcal{I}_1| = 0.106$ and
$|\mathcal{I}_2| = 0.011$. A sign ambiguity in the model parameters leads to
two possibilities for the invariant mass parameter $|m_{\beta \beta}|$: $13.02$
or $25.21$ $\text{meV}$, both within an order of magnitude of the most rigorous
experimental upper limit ($61$--$165$ $\text{meV}$).

two decades. It is still worth to present new forms of quantum walks that might
find practical applications and new physical behaviors. In this work, we define
discrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary oriented graphs by partitioning a
graph into tessellations, which is a collection of disjoint cliques that cover
the vertex set. By using the adjacency matrices associated with the
tessellations, we define local unitary operators, whose product is the
evolution operator of our quantum walk model. We introduce a parameter, called
alpha, that quantifies the amount of orientation. We show that the parameter
alpha can be tuned in order to increase the amount of quantum walk-based
transport on oriented graphs.

  Vehicular Fog Networks","  Through connecting intelligent vehicles as well as the roadside
infrastructure, the perception range of vehicles can be significantly extended,
and hidden objects at blind spots can be efficiently detected and avoided. To
realize this, accurate road map data must be downloaded in real time to these
intelligent vehicles for navigation and localization purposes. Besides, the
cloud must be updated with dynamic changes that happened in the road network.
These involve the transmissions of high-definition 3D road map data for
accurately representing the physical environments. In this work, we propose
solutions under the fog computing architecture in a heterogeneous vehicular
network to optimize data exchange among intelligent vehicles, the roadside
infrastructure, as well as regional databases. Specifically, the efficiency of
3D road map data dissemination at roadside fog nodes is achieved by exploiting
index coding techniques to reduce the overall data load, while opportunistic
scheduling of heterogeneous transmissions can be done to judiciously manage
network resources and minimize operating cost. In addition, 3D point cloud
coding and hashing techniques are applied to expedite the updates of various
dynamic changes in the network. We empirically evaluate the proposed solutions
based on real-world mobility traces of vehicles and 3D LIght Detection And
Ranging (LIDAR) data of city streets. The proposed system is also implemented
in a multi-robotic testbed for practical evaluation.

micro-world being statistical or strict began in 1924, and conflicting
viewpoints remain today. The former is mainly supported theoretically, but the
latter has been proved by many experiments. Here we explain that in principle,
the strict conservation law of momentum always holds in the entangled state
form of the momentum eigenstates of a closed composite system with interactions
among subsystems, by expanding the total wave function to the sum of the
products of momentum eigenstates of subsystems. Common scenario is that one of
the two subsystems of a composite system is large or strong, its state remains
approximately unchanged in a short time and the entangled state can be
approximately written as a product state, which can be easily deduced from the
paper of Haroche's group in 2001. The considered micro-subsystem can be
approximately represented as the superposition of its different momentum
eigenstates; therefore, the approximation can be used to explain why the law
holds statistically for the subsystem and for any single particle due to
neglecting the interactions with the large subsystem or the environment. So the
two momentum conservation laws reasonably hold without conflicts.

o-H$_2$D$^+(J_{K_a,\,K_c}=1_{1,\,0}-1_{1,\,1})$ line towards three prestellar

APEX observations of C$^{17}$O, C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$, and N$_2$D$^+$ line
emission, and 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission towards the target sources.
The o-H$_2$D$^+$ line was detected in all three prestellar cores, but in only
one of the protostellar cores. The corresponding o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundances were
derived to be $\sim(12-30)\times10^{-11}$ and $6\times10^{-11}$. Two additional
spectral lines, DCO$^+(5-4)$ and N$_2$H$^+(4-3)$, were detected in the observed
frequency bands with high detection rates of $100\%$ and $83\%$, respectively.
The Orion B9 cores were found to be consistent with the relationship between
the o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance and gas temperature obeyed by other low-mass dense
cores. The o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance was found to decrease as the core evolves.
The o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundances in the Orion B9 cores are in line with those found
in other low-mass cores and larger than derived for high-mass star-forming
regions. The higher o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance in prestellar cores compared to that

higher concentrations of gas-phase CO and elevated gas temperature accelerate
the destruction of H$_2$D$^+$. The validity of using the
[o-H$_2$D$^+$]/[N$_2$D$^+$] ratio as an evolutionary indicator, which has been
proposed for massive clumps, remains to be determined when applied to these

mass-shell, it is questionable to apply the Landau equation to study the
Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules. Furthermore, we carry out the operator
product expansion in the deep Euclidean region $p^2\to -\infty$, where the
Landau singularities cannot exist. The Landau equation servers as a kinematical
equation in the momentum space, and is independent on the factorizable and
nonfactorizable properties of the Feynman diagrams in the color space. The
meson-meson scattering state and tetraquark molecular state both have four
valence quarks, which form two color-neutral clusters, we cannot distinguish
the contributions based on the two color-neutral clusters in the factorizable
Feynman diagrams. Lucha, Melikhov and Sazdjian assert that the contributions at
the order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^k)$ with $k\leq1$ in the operator product
expansion, which are factorizable in the color space, are exactly canceled out
by the meson-meson scattering states at the hadron side, the tetraquark
molecular states begin to receive contributions at the order
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. Such an assertion is questionable, we refute the
assertion in details, and choose an axialvector current and a tensor current to
examine the outcome of the assertion. After detailed analysis, we observe that
the meson-meson scattering states cannot saturate the QCD sum rules, while the
tetraquark molecular states can saturate the QCD sum rules. The Landau equation
is of no use to study the Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules for the

at vacancy defects and inter-edge scattering mediated by multiple co-operating
impurities, possibly non-magnetic. We discuss their drastic consequences for
typical non-local transport measurements as well as strategies to mitigate
their negative impact. Finally, we provide an instructive comparison of the
transport properties of topologically protected edge states to those of the
trivial edge states in MoS$_2$ ribbons. Although we focus on a few specific

sets with parameters from the commonly-used universal Gaussian basis set (UGBS)

non-relativistic spin-restricted spherical Hartree-Fock total energies from
fully numerical calculations to better accuracy than UGBS, which is shown to
exhibit huge errors for some elements, e.g. 0.19 $E_{h}$ for Th$^+$ and 0.13
$E_{h}$ for Lu as it has been parametrized for a single atomic configuration.
Having shown the feasibility of the one-electron approach, partially
energy-optimized basis sets are formed for all atoms in the periodic table,
$1\leq Z\leq118$, by optimizing the even-tempered parameters for $Z^{(Z-1)+}$.
As the hydrogenic Gaussian basis sets suggested in the present work are built
strictly from first principles, also polarization shells can be obtained in the
same fashion in contrast to previous approaches. The accuracy of the polarized
basis sets is demonstrated by calculations on a small set of molecules by
comparison to fully numerical reference values, which show that chemical
accuracy can be reached even for challenging cases like SF$_6$. The present
approach is straightforward to extend to relativistic calculations, and could
facilitate studies beyond the established periodic table.

it to be Tipler strong has been used to restrict the parameters that represent
the non-linear relation between the physical radius and the radial coordinate
of the outgoing radial null geodesic at the singular center. Studying end state
of a collapsing cloud requires information about the dynamics of collapse,
which is unknown in a general scenario. Hence we study small perturbations to
the mass profile for inhomogeneous dust, which is possible using the formalism
developed here. This perturbed mass profile, in turn, gives rise to non-zero
pressure. We show the existence of a non-zero measure set of initial data
giving rise to such strong curvature naked singularity.

societies -- must communicate efficiently to function properly: e.g., allowing
electrochemical signals to travel quickly among functionally connected neuronal
areas in the human brain, or allowing for fast navigation of humans and goods
in complex transportation landscapes. The coexistence of different types of
relationships among the units, entailing a multilayer represention in which

the quality of information exchange among them. While altering the structure of
such systems -- e.g., by physically adding (or removing) units, connections or
layers -- might be costly, coupling the dynamics of subset(s) of layers in a
way that reduces the number of redundant diffusion pathways across the
multilayer system, can potentially accelerate the overall information flow. To
this aim, we introduce a framework for functional reducibility which allow us
to enhance transport phenomena in multilayer systems by coupling layers
together with respect to dynamics rather than structure. Mathematically, the
optimal configuration is obtained by maximizing the deviation of system's
entropy from the limit of free and non-interacting layers. Our results provide
a transparent procedure to reduce diffusion time and optimize non-compact

  merger","  We argue that the kilonova/macronova associated with the gravitational-wave
event GW190425 could have been bright enough to be detected if it was caused by
the merger of a low-mass black hole and a neutron star. Although tidal
disruption occurs for such a low-mass black hole as is generally expected, the
masses of the dynamical ejecta are limited to <~10^{-3}M_sun, which is
consistent with previous work in the literature. The remnant disk could be as
massive as 0.05--0.1M_sun, and the disk outflow of ~0.01--0.03M_sun is likely
to be driven by viscous or magnetohydrodynamic effects. The disk outflow may
not be neutron-rich enough to synthesize an abundance of lanthanide elements,
even in the absence of strong neutrino emitter, if the ejection is driven on
the viscous time scale of >~0.3s. If this is the case, the opacity of the disk
outflow is kept moderate, and a kilonova/macronova at the distance of GW190425
reaches a detectable brightness of 20--21mag at 1day after merger for most
viewing angles. If some disk activity ejects the mass within ~0.1s, instead,
lanthanide-rich outflows would be launched and the detection of emission
becomes challenging. Future possible detections of kilonovae/macronovae from
GW190425-like systems will disfavor the prompt collapse of binary neutron stars
and a non-disruptive low-mass black hole--neutron star binary associated with a
small neutron-star radius, whose mass ejection is negligible. The host-galaxy

2001.04476v1,2020-01-13,2020-01-13,"Why binary interaction does not necessarily dominate the formation of
  Wolf-Rayet stars at low metallicity","  Classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are massive, hydrogen depleted, post
main-sequence stars that exhibit emission-line dominated spectra. For a given
metallicity Z, stars exceeding a certain initial mass M_single(Z) can reach the
WR phase through intrinsic mass-loss (single-star channel). Stars of lower
masses can reach the WR phase via binary mass transfer (binary channel). It is
commonly assumed that the binary channel dominates the formation of WR stars in
environments with low Z such as the SMC and LMC. However, their reported WR
binary fractions of 30-40% are comparable to that of the Galaxy. Here, we
explain this apparent contradiction by considering the minimum initial mass
M_spec(Z) needed for the stripped product to appear as a WR star. We calibrate
M_spec(Z) using the lowest-luminosity WR stars in the Clouds and the Galaxy. A
range of M_single(Z) values are explored using various evolution codes. We
estimate the additional contribution of the binary channel by considering the
interval [M_spec(Z), M_single(Z)], which characterises the initial-mass range
in which binaries can form additional WR stars.
  Results: The WR-phenomenon ceases below luminosities of logL = 4.9, 5.25, and
5.6 [Lsun] in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC, which translates to He-star masses of
7.5, 11, 17 Msun and initial masses of M_spec = 18, 23, 37 Msun. Stripped stars
with lower initial masses in the respective galaxies would tend to not appear
as WR stars. M_single lies in the range 20-30, 30-60, and > 40 Msun for the
Galaxy, LMC, and SMC. We find that that the additional contribution of the
binary channel is a non-trivial function of Z that cannot be conclusively
claimed to be monotonically increasing with decreasing Z. Hence, one should not
a-priori expect that binary interactions become increasingly important in
forming WR stars at low Z, or that the WR binary fraction grows with decreasing
Z.

the horizon of an extremal black hole, we construct the metrics for certain

radial coordinate, up to sufficient order to be able to compute the Aretakis

four-dimensional STU supergravity (including the Kerr-Newman black hole in the
equal-charge case) and the general 3-charge black holes in five-dimensional STU
supergravity. We also investigate the circumstances under which the Aretakis
charges of an extremal black hole can be mapped by conformal inversion of the
metric into Newman-Penrose charges at null infinity. We show that while this
works for four-dimensional static black holes, a simple radial inversion fails
in rotating cases because a necessary conformal symmetry of the massless scalar
equation breaks down. We also discuss that a massless scalar field in
dimensions higher than four does not have any conserved Newman-Penrose charge,
even in a static asymptotically flat spacetime.

dwarf and is located inside its region of temperate irradiation. We report on
the search for hydrogen escape from the atmosphere K2-18 b using Lyman-$\alpha$
transit spectroscopy with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)
instrument installed on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We analyzed the
time-series of the fluxes of the stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of K2-18 in
both its blue- and redshifted wings. We found that the average blueshifted
emission of K2-18 decreases by $67\% \pm 18\%$ during the transit of the planet
compared to the pre-transit emission, tentatively indicating the presence of H
atoms escaping vigorously and being blown away by radiation pressure. This
interpretation is not definitive because it relies on one partial transit.
Based on the reconstructed Lyman-$\alpha$ emission of K2-18, we estimate an EUV
irradiation between $10^1-10^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total escape rate
in the order of $10^8$ g s$^{-1}$. The inferred escape rate suggests that the
planet will lose only a small fraction (< 1%) of its mass and retain its
volatile-rich atmosphere during its lifetime. More observations are needed to
rule out stellar variability effects, confirm the in-transit absorption and
better assess the atmospheric escape and high-energy environment of K2-18 b.

$\Xi_{cc}^{++}, \Xi_{cc}^+$ and $\Omega_{cc}^+$ are studied in this work. To
estimate the nonfactorizable contributions, we work in the pole model for the
$P$-wave amplitudes and current algebra for $S$-wave ones. For the
$\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to \Xi_c^+\pi^+$ mode, we find a large destructive interference
between factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions for both $S$- and
$P$-wave amplitudes. Our prediction of $\sim 0.70\%$ for its branching fraction
is smaller than the earlier estimates in which nonfactorizable effects were not
considered, but agrees nicely with the result based on an entirely different
approach, namely, the covariant confined quark model. On the contrary, a large
constructive interference was found in the $P$-wave amplitude by Dhir and
Sharma, leading to a branching fraction of order $(7-16)\%$. Using the current
results for the absolute branching fractions of $(\Lambda_c^+,\Xi_c^+)\to p
K^-\pi^+$ and the LHCb measurement of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+$ relative
to $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Lambda_c^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^+$, we obtain
$\B(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+)_{\rm expt}\approx (1.83\pm1.01)\%$ after
employing the latest prediction of
$\B(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Sigma_c^{++}\overline{K}^{*0})$. Our prediction of
$\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+)\approx 0.7\%$ is thus consistent
with the experimental value but in the lower end. It is important to pin down
the branching fraction of this mode in future study. Factorizable and
nonfactorizable $S$-wave amplitudes interfere constructively in
$\Xi_{cc}^+\to\Xi_c^0\pi^+$. Its large branching fraction of order 4\% may
enable experimentalists to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^+$ through this mode. That
is, the $\Xi_{cc}^+$ is reconstructed through the $\Xi_{cc}^+\to\Xi_c^0\pi^+$

sequences based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements
for all the legitimate users. The pilot design is capable of achieving the SINR
requirements for all users even in the presence of PC. However, this design has
some intrinsic limitations and vulnerabilities, such as a known pilot sequence
and the non-zero cross-correlation among different pilot sequences. We reveal
that such vulnerabilities may be exploited by an active attacker to increase PC

vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an active attacker. Based on this
analysis, we develop an effective active attack strategy in the massive MIMO

  and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization","  The $f$-$d$ magnetic exchange interaction is considered to be a key
ingredient for many exotic topological phases in pyrochlore iridates. Here, we
have investigated the evolution of structural, magnetic and electronic
properties in doped pyrochlore iridate, (Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Apart
from geometrical frustration, pyrochlore iridates are well known for its active
spin-orbit coupling effect. The substitution of Pr$^{3+}$ (4$f^2$) for the
nonmagnetic Y$^{3+}$ (4$d^0$) acts as a magnetic doping, which provides an
ideal platform to study $f$-$d$ exchange interaction without altering the
Ir-sublattice. With Pr substitution, system retains its original cubic
structural symmetry but the local structural parameters show an evolution with
the doping concentration $x$. The robust magnetic-insulating state in
Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is drastically weakened, while Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($x$ = 1.0)
shows a paramagnetic-metallic behavior. A metal-insulator transition is
observed for $x$ = 0.8 sample. This evolution of magnetic and electronic
properties are believed to be induced by an exchange interaction between
localized Pr-4$f$ and itinerant Ir-5$d$ electrons as well as by an increased
hybridization between Ir-$t_{2g}$ and (basal) O-$p$ orbitals as observed in XAS
study. The resistivity in insulating materials follows a power-law behavior

2001.04594v1,2020-01-14,2020-01-14,2D van der Waals Nanoplatelets with Robust Ferromagnetism,"  We have synthesized unique colloidal nanoplatelets of the ferromagnetic
two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals material CrI3 and have characterized these
nanoplatelets structurally, magnetically, and by magnetic circular dichroism
spectroscopy. The isolated CrI3 nanoplatelets have lateral dimensions of ~25 nm
and ensemble thicknesses of only ~4 nm, corresponding to just a few CrI3
monolayers. Magnetic and magneto-optical measurements demonstrate robust 2D
ferromagnetic ordering in these nanoplatelets with Curie temperatures similar
to those observed in bulk CrI3, despite the strong spatial confinement. These
data also show magnetization steps akin to those observed in micron-sized
few-layer 2D sheets and associated with concerted spin-reversal of individual
CrI3 layers within few-layer van der Waals stacks. Similar data have also been
obtained for CrBr3 and anion-alloyed Cr(I1-xBrx)3 nanoplatelets. These results
represent the first example of laterally confined 2D van der Waals ferromagnets
of any composition. The demonstration of robust ferromagnetism at nanometer
lateral dimensions opens new doors for miniaturization in spintronics devices
based on van der Waals ferromagnets.

cavity mode of microdisks, which results in a trivial symmetric backscattering
and a low controllability. Here we propose a macroscopical control of the

positive and negative backscattering directions in each single microdisk is
confirmed with two strongly coupled microdisks. Furthermore, the diabolical
points are achieved at the resonance of two microdisks, which agrees well with
the theoretical calculations considering backscattering directions. The
diabolical points in active optical structures pave a way to implement quantum
information processing with geometric phase in quantum photonic networks.

  in 1T-phase of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides","  The spin splitting driven by spin-orbit coupling in monolayer (ML) transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) family has been widely studied only for the
1H-phase structure, while it is not profound for the 1T-phase structure due to
the centrosymmetric of the crystal. Based on first-principles calculations, we
show that significant spin splitting can be induced in the ML 1T-TMDCs by
introducing the line defect. Taking the ML PtSe2 as a representative example,
we considered the most stable form of the line defects, namely Se-vacancy line
defect (Se-VLD). We find that large spin splitting is observed in the defect
states of the Se-VLD, exhibiting a highly unidirectional spin configuration in
the momentum space. This peculiar spin configuration may yield the so-called
persistent spin textures (PST), a specific spin structure resulting in
protection against spin-decoherence and supporting an extraordinarily long spin
lifetime. Moreover, by using k.p perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry
analysis, we clarified that the emerging of the spin splitting maintaining the
PST in the defect states is originated from the inversion symmetry breaking
together with one-dimensional nature of the Se-VLD engineered ML PtSe2. Our
findings pave a possible way to induce the significant spin splitting in the ML
1T-TMDCs, which could be highly important for designing spintronic devices.

2001.04655v1,2020-01-14,2020-01-14,The effect of drifts on the decay phase of SEP events,"  We study the effect of the magnetic gradient and curvature drifts on the
pitch-angle dependent transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs), focusing
on 3 - 36 MeV protons. By considering observers located at various positions in
the heliosphere, we investigate how drifts may alter the measured
intensity-time profiles and energy spectra. We focus on the decay phase of
solar energetic proton events during which a temporal invariant spectrum and
disappearing spatial intensity gradients are often observed; a phenomenon known
as the 'reservoir effect' or the 'SEP flood'. We study the effects of drifts by
solving the focused transport equation for nominal Parker solar wind
configurations and for a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generated solar wind
containing a corotating interaction region (CIR). The latter configuration
contains a magnetic bottle structure, with one bottleneck at the Sun and the
other at the CIR. It is illustrated that observers magnetically connected close
to the edges of the particle injection site can experience, as a result of
drifts, a sudden drop in the intensities occurring at different times for
different energies such that no SEP flood phenomenon is established. In the
magnetic bottle, this effect is enhanced due to the presence of magnetic field
gradients strengthening the nominal particle drifts. We also show that
interplanetary cross-field diffusion may mitigate these effects of drifts. We
conclude that particle drifts can in some cases substantially modify the decay
phase of SEP events, especially if the solar wind contains compression regions
or shock waves where the drifts are enhanced. This is, for example, the case
for our CIR solar wind configuration generated with a 3D MHD model, where the
effect of drifts is strong. A similar decay rate in different energy channels
and for different observers requires thus the mitigation of the effect of
drifts.

an inviscid barotropic fluid with intrinsic surface tension and capillarity;
the fluid is shown to have a nontrivial phase structure controlled by its

way to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We
study theoretically how the superposition of both effects impacts
superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions' transport
properties. Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs
through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable
transverse Hall supercurrents, to which we refer as anomalous Josephson Hall
effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, which got
initially established to quantify usual (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to
evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their
amplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths
or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. As a clear
spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound
states form around the interface. By analyzing the spectral properties of these
states, we unravel an unambiguous correlation between spin-orbit
coupling-induced asymmetries in their energies and the transverse current
response, founding the currents' microscopic origin. Moreover, skew tunneling
simultaneously acts like a transverse spin filter for spin-triplet Cooper pairs
and complements the discussed charge current phenomena by their spin current
counterparts. The junctions' universal spin-charge current cross ratios provide
valuable possibilities to experimentally detect and characterize interfacial
spin-orbit coupling.

  Cycle Consistency and Feature Alignment","  The supervised training of deep networks for semantic segmentation requires a
huge amount of labeled real world data. To solve this issue, a commonly
exploited workaround is to use synthetic data for training, but deep networks
show a critical performance drop when analyzing data with slightly different
statistical properties with respect to the training set. In this work, we
propose a novel Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategy to address the
domain shift issue between real world and synthetic representations. An
adversarial model, based on the cycle consistency framework, performs the
mapping between the synthetic and real domain. The data is then fed to a
MobileNet-v2 architecture that performs the semantic segmentation task. An
additional couple of discriminators, working at the feature level of the
MobileNet-v2, allows to better align the features of the two domain
distributions and to further improve the performance. Finally, the consistency
of the semantic maps is exploited. After an initial supervised training on
synthetic data, the whole UDA architecture is trained end-to-end considering
all its components at once. Experimental results show how the proposed strategy
is able to obtain impressive performance in adapting a segmentation network
trained on synthetic data to real world scenarios. The usage of the lightweight
MobileNet-v2 architecture allows its deployment on devices with limited
computational resources as the ones employed in autonomous vehicles.

rotating mediums, specifically for rotating thin disks in the context of EMSG,
we find a new Toomre-like criterion for the local gravitational stability.
Finally, the results are applied to a hyper-massive neutron star, as an
astrophysical system. Using a simplified toy model we have shown that, for a
positive (negative) value of the EMSG parameter $\alpha$, the system is stable
(unstable) in a wide range of $\alpha$. On the other hand, no observational
evidence has been reported on the existence of local fragmentation in HMNS.
Naturally, this means that EMSG with positive $\alpha$ is more acceptable from
the physical point of view.

$\sim 1.2$ Mpc. The integrated spectral index between 325 MHz and 1.5 GHz is
$-0.94\pm0.08$ and it steepens to $-1.77 \pm 0.20$ between 1.5 and 3.0 GHz.

  the physics lab","  The progressive introduction of the flip teaching (FT) instructional model
into higher education has accelerated in recent years. The FT methodology seems
to be especially suitable for laboratory practice sessions: before the lab
session the students are given documents and videos that explain the
theoretical contents and the experimental procedure. When this material is
studied in advance, the practice session can be devoted to the discussion,
clarification and practical application of the acquired knowledge. This paper
describes the effect of the FT methodology on the students' academic
performance when it was applied to the laboratory practice in two subjects,
Physics and Electricity, of a technical degree. The laboratory and final grades
of these subjects were compared in four consecutive years. The characteristics
of all four years were quite similar, except that the traditional teaching
method (TM) was used in two, while FT was applied in the other two. The
statistical analysis shows that the academic results of the students were
better in both subjects under FT than those obtained using TM, and that the
difference was statistically significant.

galaxy centers in various J transitions. More than 60 galaxies were measured in
at least four lines. The average relative intensities of the first four 12CO
transitions are 1.00 : 0.92 : 0.70 : 0.57. The average 12CO-to-13CO ratios are
13.0, 11.6, and 12.8 for the first three transitiions. The sizes of central CO
concentrations are well defined in maps, but poorly determined by
multi-aperture photometry. Using radiative transfer models (RADEX), we derived
model gas parameters, where the assumed carbon elemental abundances and carbon
gas depletion onto dust are the main causes of uncertainty. The new CO data and
published [CI] and [CII] data imply that CO, Co, and C+ each represent about
one-third of the gas-phase carbon in the molecular interstellar medium in

density is N(H2) = (1.5+/-0.2) x 10^(21) cm^(2) and CO-to-H2 conversion factors
are typically ten times lower than the `standard' Milky Way disk value, with a
mean X(CO) = (1.9+/-0.2) x 10^(19) cm^(2)/K km/s. The corresponding [CI]-to-H2
factor is five times higher than X(CO), with X[CI] = (9+/-2) x 10^(19) cm^(2)/K

molecular gas content of galaxy centers relative to their CO intensities is
explained in roughly equal parts by higher central gas-phase carbon abundances,
elevated gas temperatures, and larger gas velocity dispersions than found in

the SPIRE FTS spectrometer on the Herschel Space Observatory. We use these data
along with resolved CO line intensities from $J_\mathrm{up} = 1$ to 7 to
interpret what phase of the interstellar medium the [CI] lines trace within
typical local galaxies. A tight, linear relation is found between the
intensities of the CO(4-3) and [CI](2-1) lines; we hypothesize this is due to
the similar upper level temperature of these two lines. We modeled the [CI] and
CO line emission using large velocity gradient models combined with an
empirical template. According to this modeling, the [CI](1-0) line is clearly
dominated by the low-excitation component. We determine [CI] to molecular mass
conversion factors for both the [CI](1-0) and [CI](2-1) lines, with mean values
of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}} = 7.3$ M$_{\mathrm{sun}}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s

km$^{-1}$ s pc$^{-2}$ with logarithmic root-mean-square spreads of 0.20 and
0.32 dex, respectively. The similar spread of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}}$ to
$\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$ (derived using the CO(2-1) line) suggests that [CI](1-0)
may be just as good a tracer of cold molecular gas as CO(2-1) in galaxies of
this type. On the other hand, the wider spread of $\alpha_{\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}}$
and the tight relation found between [CI](2-1) and CO(4-3) suggest that much of
the [CI](2-1) emission may originate in warmer molecular gas.

different ice mantles of varying compositions experimentally, in order to
evaluate their potential impact on astrochemical models. The sputtering yields
of complex organic molecules is of particular interest, since few mechanisms
are efficient enough to induce a significant feedback to the gas phase. We
irradiated methanol and carbon dioxide ice mixtures of varying ratios with
swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the
evolution of the infrared spectra and the species released to the gas phase
with a mass spectrometer. Methanol and 13C-methanol isotopologue were used to
remove any ambiguity on the measured irradiation products. The sputtering of
methanol embedded in carbon dioxide ice is an efficient process leading to the
ejection of intact methanol in the gas phase. We establish that when methanol
is embedded in a carbon-dioxide-rich mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a
significant fraction is sputtered as intact molecules. The sputtered fraction
follows the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter
evolving with time due to the radiolysis-induced evolution of the bulk. If
methanol is embedded in a carbon dioxide ice matrix, as the analyses of the
spectral shape of the CO2 bending mode observations in some lines of sight
suggest, the overall methanol sputtering yield is higher than if embedded in a
water ice mantle. The sputtering is increased by a factor close to the dominant
ice matrix sputtering yield, which is about six times higher for pure carbon
dioxide ice when compared to water ice. These experiments are further
constraining the cosmic-ray-induced ice mantle sputtering mechanisms important
role in the gas-phase release of complex organic molecules from the

opportunities for manipulating few-body systems. Here, we present the first
bottom-up assembly of atom triads. We directly observe atom loss through
inelastic collisions at the single event level, overcoming the substantial
challenge in many-atom experiments of distinguishing one-, two-, and
three-particle processes. We measure a strong suppression of three-body loss,
which is not fully explained by the presently availably theory for three-body
processes. The suppression of losses could indicate the presence of local
anti-correlations due to the interplay of attractive short range interactions
and low dimensional confinement. Our methodology opens a promising pathway in
experimental few-body dynamics.

shows that directed observation of supermassive black holes would be a
promising way to test general relativity in strong gravity field regime. In
order to calculate shadow of rotating black holes with respect to observers
located at finite distance, orthonormal tetrads have been introduced in
previous works. However, it is noticed that different choice of tetrads does
not lead to the same shape of shadow for observers in near regions. In this
paper, we alternatively use formula of astrometric observables for calculating
the shadow of a general rotating black hole with respect to these observers.
For the sake of intuitive, we also consider Kerr-de Sitter black holes as a
representative example. In this space-time, size and shape of Kerr-de Sitter
black hole shadows are expressed as functions of distance between the black
hole and observer. It is forecasted that the distortion of shadow would
increase with distance.

  data","  Corona-Australis is one of the nearest regions to the Sun with recent and
ongoing star formation, but the current picture of its stellar (and substellar)
content is not complete yet. We take advantage of the second data release of
the Gaia space mission to revisit the stellar census and search for additional
members of the young stellar association in Corona-Australis. We applied a
probabilistic method to infer membership probabilities based on a
multidimensional astrometric and photometric data set over a field of 128
deg$^{2}$ around the dark clouds of the region. We identify 313
high-probability candidate members to the Corona-Australis association, 262 of
which had never been reported as members before. Our sample of members covers
the magnitude range between $G\gtrsim5$ mag and $G\lesssim20$ mag, and it
reveals the existence of two kinematically and spatially distinct subgroups.
There is a distributed `off-cloud' population of stars located in the north of
the dark clouds that is twice as numerous as the historically known `on-cloud'
population that is concentrated around the densest cores. By comparing the
location of the stars in the HR-diagram with evolutionary models, we show that
these two populations are younger than 10 Myr. Based on their infrared excess
emission, we identify 28 Class II and 215 Class III stars among the sources
with available infrared photometry, and we conclude that the frequency of Class
II stars (i.e. `disc-bearing' stars) in the on-cloud region is twice as large
as compared to the off-cloud population. The distance derived for the
Corona-Australis region based on this updated census is $d=149.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$
pc, which exceeds previous estimates by about 20 pc.In this paper we provide
the most complete census of stars in Corona-Australis available to date that
can be confirmed with Gaia data.

to get the complementary benefits. However, technological companies are

annotation-based approaches, including some well-known combinations, are not
appropriate to model and implement the variability of web applications; and
(ii) present a combined approach that effectively integrates annotations into a

little-studied in a systematic manner. Starting from a diverse number of seed
videos, we first describe the properties of the sets of suggested videos in
order to design a sound exploration protocol able to capture latent
recommendation graphs recursively induced by these suggestions. These graphs
form the background of potential user navigations along non-personalized
recommendations. From there, be it in topological, topical or temporal terms,
we show that the landscape of what we call mean-field YouTube recommendations
is often prone to confinement dynamics. Moreover, the most confined
recommendation graphs i.e., potential bubbles, seem to be organized around sets
of videos that garner the highest audience and thus plausibly viewing time.

spreading away from the quenched interval as time increases. If the quench
excites a single-quasiparticle mode, oscillations with the frequency of the

are to monitor and control environments. Also, sensor nodes distribute based on
network usage. One of the most significant issues in this type of network is
the energy consumption of sensor nodes. In fixed-sink networks, nodes which are
near the sink act as an interface to transfer data of other nodes to sink. This
causes the energy consumption of sensors reduces rapidly. Therefore, the
lifetime of the network declines. Sensor nodes owing to their weaknesses are
susceptible to several threats, one of which is denial-of-sleep attack (DoSA)
threatening WSN. Hence, the DoSA refers to the energy loss in these nodes by
maintaining the nodes from entering energy-saving and sleep mode. In this
paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on mobile sink, firefly algorithm
based on leach, and Hopfield neural network (WSN-FAHN). Thus, mobile sink is
applied to both improve energy consumption and increase network lifetime.
Firefly algorithm is proposed to cluster nodes and authenticate in two levels
to prevent from DoSA. In addition, Hopfield neural network detects the
direction route of the sink movement to send data of CH. Furthermore, here
WSN-FAHN technique is assessed through wide simulations performed in the NS-2

We use these nematic orders to characterize different quantum phases and
quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we study a spin-$1$

beyond nearest neighbors. We focus on parameter regions around the highly
symmetric $SU(3)$ point where the bilinear and biquadratic interactions are
equal. With growing further-neighbor biquadratic interactions, we identify
different spin dipolar and quadrupolar orders. We find that the DMRG results on
cylindrical geometries correctly detect nematicity in different quantum states

Therefore, spin-driven nematicity -- here defined as the spontaneous breaking
of the lattice invariance under a 90$^o$ rotation -- is an order parameter

  standard siren observation from the Cosmic Explorer","  The third-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detector, Cosmic
Explorer (CE), is scheduled to start its observation in the 2030s. In this
paper, we make a forecast for cosmological parameter estimation with
gravitational-wave standard siren observation from the CE. We use the simulated
GW standard siren data of CE to constrain the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and CPL
models. We combine the simulated GW data with the current cosmological
electromagnetic observations including the latest cosmic microwave background
anisotropies data from Planck, the optical baryon acoustic oscillation
measurements, and the type Ia supernovae observation (Pantheon compilation) to
do the analysis. We find that the future standard siren observation from CE
will improve the cosmological parameter estimation to a great extent, since the
future GW standard siren data can well break the degeneracies generated by the
optical observations between various cosmological parameters. We also find that
the CE's constraining capability on the cosmological parameters is slightly
better than that of the same-type GW detector, the Einstein Telescope. In
addition, the synergy between the GW standard siren observation from CE and the
21 cm emission observation from SKA is also discussed.

quickly ideate layouts they do not believe they would have thought of on their

  disk explaining radial and vertical velocities","  Context: In our Paper I, by using statistical deconvolution methods, extended
kinematics maps of Gaia-DR2 data have been produced in a range of heliocentric
distances that are a factor of two to three larger than those analyzed
previously by the Gaia Collaboration with the same data. It added the range of
Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20 kpc to the previous maps.
  Aims: Here, we investigate the dynamical effects produced by different
mechanisms that can explain the radial and vertical components of these
extended kinematic maps, including a decomposition of bending and breathing of
the vertical components. This paper as a whole tries to be a compendium of
different dynamical mechanisms whose predictions can be compared to the
kinematic maps.
  Methods: Using analytical methods or simulations, we are able to predict the
main dynamical factors and compare them to the predictions of the extended
kinematic maps of Gaia-DR2.
  Results: The gravitational influence of Galactic components that are
different from the disk, such as the long bar or bulge, the spiral arms, or a
tidal interaction with Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, may explain some features of
the velocity maps, especially in the inner parts of the disk. However, they are
not sufficient in explaining the most conspicuous gradients in the outer disk.
Vertical motions might be dominated by external perturbations or mergers,
although a minor component may be due to a warp whose amplitude evolves with
time. Here, we show with two different methods, which analyze the dispersion of
velocities, that the mass distribution of the disk is flared. Despite these
partial explanations, the main observed features can only be explained in terms
of out-of-equilibrium models, which are either due to external perturbers or to
the fact that the disk has not had time to reach equilibrium since its
formation.

undergo reconnection above the photosphere. We also found that the border

a systematic variation of area asymmetry. Area asymmetry peaks right after the
line core intensity enhancement and gradually declines thereafter. Analyzing
Stokes profiles recorded from either side of the polarity inversion line could
therefore potentially provide additional information on the reconnection
process related to magnetic flux cancelation. Further analysis without assuming

on general cosmological stability constraints and the nature of screening for
the surviving theories, pointing out that a raised strong coupling scale can
ensure compatibility with gravitational wave constraints, while maintaining a

two-dimensional conformal field theories, such as logarithmic negativity, odd
entropy, and reflected entropy, after quantum quenches of various kinds. These
correlation measures, in the holographic context, are all associated to the
entanglement wedge cross section. We contrast various classes of conformal
field theories, both rational and irrational (pure) conformal field theories.
First, for rational conformal field theories, whose dynamics can be well
described by the quasi-particle picture, we find all four quantities for
disjoint intervals to be proportional, regardless of the specific quench
protocol. Second, using the light cone bootstrap, we generalize our results to
irrational conformal field theories where we find sharp distinctions from the
quasi-particle results and striking differences between mutual information and
the other measures. The large surplus of logarithmic negativity relative to
mutual information forces us to reconsider what mutual information and
logarithmic negativity really measure. We interpret these results as a
signature of information scrambling and chaos in irrational theories. These CFT
results perfectly agree with our gravitational (holographic) calculations.
Furthermore, using holography, we are able to generalize the results to outside
of the light cone limit. Finally, due to the breakdown of the quasi-particle
picture for irrational theories, we appeal to the ""line-tension picture,""
motivated by random unitary circuits, as a phenomenological description. We
observe that random unitary circuits, with local Hilbert space dimension
determined by the Cardy formula, have precisely the same entanglement dynamics
as irrational (including holographic) conformal field theories.

We present a coded aperture assembly technique which can be restructured
easily, as well as the reduction of the intrinsic noise of coded apertures
constructed with this technique, when they localize spatially extended
{\gamma}-emitters. Specifically, Modified-Uniformly-Redundant-Array (MURA)
coded apertures are structured by embedding lead spheres in a matrix of
positions machined inside a transparent medium such as acrylic glass, resulting
in an advantageous transparent to opaque area ratio and thus an improved
detection efficiency. This configuration also induces a systematic,
element-wise, noise on the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the correlation
matrix. When imaging with these apertures extended hot-spots, a penumbra
phenomenon occurrs and reduces this intrinsic noise, in the way a kernel filter
does. Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) is used to analyze the effect of this
phenomenon on the correlation matrix and to explain the maximization of its
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for certain extent of the hot-spots. Simulations
have been used for the detailed study of the SNR dependence on the dimensions
of the hot-spot, while experiments with two 99mTc cylindrical sources with 11mm

reduction of the intrinsic noise. The results define the way of optimization of

search for exoplanetary transits through high precision photometry of bright
stars already known to host planets. The telescope will provide the unique
capability of determining accurate radii for planets whose masses have already
been measured from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. This will allow a
first-order characterisation of the planets' internal structure through the
determination of the bulk density, providing direct insight into their
composition. The CHEOPS simulator has been developed to perform detailed
simulations of the data which is to be received from the CHEOPS satellite. It
generates accurately simulated images that can be used to explore design
options and to test the on-ground data processing, in particular, the pipeline
producing the photometric time series. It is, thus, a critical tool for
estimating the photometric performance expected in flight and to guide
photometric analysis. It can be used to prepare observations, consolidate the
noise budget, and asses the performance of CHEOPS in realistic astrophysical
fields that are difficult to reproduce in the laboratory. Images generated by
CHEOPSim take account of many detailed effects, including variations of the
incident signal flux and backgrounds, and detailed modelling of the satellite
orbit, pointing jitter and telescope optics, as well as the CCD response, noise
and readout. The simulator results presented in this paper have been used in
the context of validating the data reduction processing chain, in which image
time series generated by CHEOPSim were used to generate light curves for
simulated planetary transits across real and simulated targets. Independent
analysts were successfully able to detect the planets and measure their radii
to an accuracy within the science requirements of the mission.

  candidate LiZnSb on GaSb (111)B","  A major challenge for ferroelectric devices is the depolarization field,
which competes with and often destroys long-range polar order in the limit of
ultrathin films. Recent theoretical predictions suggest a new class of
materials, termed hyperferroelectics, that should be robust against the
depolarization field and enable ferroelectricity down to the monolayer limit.
Here we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of hexagonal LiZnSb, one of the
hyperferroelectric candidate materials, by molecular-beam epitaxy on GaSb
(111)B substrates. Due to the high volatility of all three atomic species, we
find that LiZnSb can be grown in an adsorption-controlled window, using an
excess zinc flux. Within this window, the desired polar hexagonal phase is
stabilized with respect to a competing cubic polymorph, as revealed by X-ray
diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements. First-principles
calculations show that for moderate amounts of epitaxial strain and moderate
concentrations of Li vacancies, the cubic LiZnSb phase is lower in formation
energy than the hexagonal phase, but only by a few meV per formula unit.
Therefore we suggest that kinetics plays a role in stabilizing the desired
hexagonal phase at low temperatures. Our results provide a path towards
experimentally demonstrating ferroelectricity and hyperferroelectricity in a
new class of ternary intermetallic compounds.

five, accompanying a blueshift of the peak location by about 2 nm. A
double-peak line profile due to the rotational levels of the molecular core can
be resolved. This bubble model also allows us to evaluate the stiffness of the

scattering off thermal phonons. Our results will aid the design of future

the Mott- to the Slater-type. The Mott-gap at $x = 0$ persists to high
temperature and evolves without an anomaly across the N\'{e}el temperature,
$T_N$. Upon Rh-doping, it collapses rather rapidly and vanishes around $x =
0.055$. Notably, just as the Mott-gap vanishes yet another gap appears that is
of the Slater-type and develops right below $T_N$. This Slater-gap is only
partial and is accompanied by a reduced scattering rate of the remaining free
carriers, similar as in the parent compounds of the iron arsenide
superconductors.

  bulges","  Radial age gradients hold the cumulative record of the multitude of physical
processes driving the build-up of stellar populations and the ensuing star
formation (SF) quenching process in galaxy bulges, therefore potentially
sensitive discriminators between competing theoretical concepts on bulge
formation and evolution. Based on spectral modeling of integral field
spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey, we derive mass- and light-weighted
stellar age gradients ($\nabla$(t,B)L,M) within the photometrically determined
bulge radius (RB) of a representative sample of local face-on late-type
galaxies that span 2.6 dex in stellar mass. Our analysis documents a trend for
decreasing $\nabla$(t,B)L,M with increasing M,T, with high-mass bulges
predominantly showing negative age gradients and vice versa. The inversion from
positive to negative $\nabla$(t,B)L,M occurs at logM,T ~ 10, which roughly
coincides with the transition from lower-mass bulges whose gas excitation is
powered by SF to bulges classified as Composite, LINER or Seyfert. We discuss
two limiting cases for the origin of radial age gradients in massive LTG
bulges. The first assumes that the stellar age in the bulge is initially
spatially uniform, thus the observed age gradients arise from an inside-out SF
quenching (ioSFQ) front that is radially expanding with a mean velocity vq. In
this case, the age gradients translate into a slow ioSFQ that lasts until z~2,
suggesting mild negative feedback by SF or an AGN. If negative age gradients in
massive bulges are not due to ioSFQ but primarily due to their inside-out
formation process, then the standard hypothesis of quasi-monolithic bulge
formation has to be discarded in favor of a scenario that involves gradual
buildup of stellar mass over 2-3 Gyr through, e.g., inside-out SF and inward
migration of SF clumps from the disk. In this case, rapid AGN-driven ioSFQ
cannot be ruled out.

diameter inner main-belt asteroid in the Phocaea family, notable for its
sporadic, comet-like ejection of dust. This curious behavior has been mainly
interpreted as reconfigurations after YORP spin-up, although merging of a
contact binary system cannot be fully excluded. We collected optical
observations along the 2019 March-April period, at orbital phase angles between
$12^{\circ}-21^{\circ}$, to search for direct evidence of asteroid quick
spinning rotation. A prevailing period value of $3.34 \pm 0.02$ hours is
supported by our and other photometric observations. In the YORP spin-up
hypothesis, this period points to a bulk density $\rho \approx 1$

$V-R_{c} = +0.28_{\pm 0.06}$ and $B-R_{c} = +1.11_{\pm 0.4}$, but we have
observed a strong bluer color during the April session, with about $\Delta

velocity-dependent one-scale model in the context of cosmological models having
a power law evolution of the scale factor $a$ with the cosmic time $t$ ($a

ultrathin films with non-collinear spin textures demonstrate that resonant
tunneling allows for atomic-scale spin-sensitive imaging in real space at
tip-sample distances of up to 8 nm. Spin-polarized resonance states evolving
between the foremost atom of a magnetic probe tip and the opposed magnetic
surface atom are found to provide a loophole from the hitherto existing dilemma
of losing spatial resolution when increasing the tip-sample distance in a
scanning probe setup. Bias-dependent series of SP-STM images recorded via
resonant tunneling reveal spin sensitivity at resonance conditions, indicating
that the spin-polarized resonance states act as mediators for the spin contrast
across the nm-spaced vacuum gap. With technically feasible distances in the nm
regime, resonant tunneling in SP-STM qualifies for a spin-sensitive read-write
technique with ultimate lateral resolution in future spintronic applications.

  atmospheres","  Recent theoretical, numerical, and observational work have suggested that
when a growing planet opens a gap in its disk the flow of gas into the gap is
dominated by gas falling vertically from a height of at least one gas scale
height. Our primary objective is to include, for the first time, the chemical
impact that accreting gas above the midplane will have on the resulting C/O. We
compute the accretion of gas onto planetary cores beginning at different disk
radii and track the chemical composition of the gas and small icy grains to
predict the resulting carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in their atmospheres. In our
model, all of the planets which began their evolution inward of 60 AU open a
gap in the gas disk, and hence are chemically affected by the vertically
accreting gas. Two important conclusions follow from this vertical flow: (1)
more oxygen rich icy dust grains become available for accretion onto the
planetary atmosphere. (2) The chemical composition of the gas dominates the
final C/O of planets in the inner ($<$ 20 AU) part of the disk. This implies
that with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope we can trace the disk
material that sets the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres.

between the epitaxial layer and the substrate in order to reduce the
defectiveness and improve the overall quality of the SiC epi-film. In
particular, we find that the morphology and the quality of the epi-film depends
on the carbonization temperature and the concentration of Ge in close proximity
of the Si1-xGex/SiC interface. Ge segregation at the interface influences the
film quality, and in particular a [Ge]>12% in close proximity to the interface
leads to the formation of poly-crystalls, while close to 10% induces a mirror
like morphology. Moreover, by finely tuning the Ge concentration and
carbonization temperature, crystal quality higher than that observed for SiC
grown on bare silicon is achieved.

example is the fermion-induced quantum critical point (FIQCP), in which
fluctuations of the massless Dirac fermions turn a putative Landau-de Gennes
first-order phase transition (FOPT) with a cubic boson interaction into a
continuous one. However, for the Landau-Devonshire theory, which characterizes
another very large class of FOPTs, its fate under the coupling with extra
fluctuations has not been explored. Here, we discover a new type of FIQCP, in
which the Dirac fermion fluctuations round the boson Landau-Devonshire FOPT
into a continuous phase transition. By using the functional renormalization
group analyses, we determine the condition for the appearance of this FIQCP.
Moreover, we point out that the present FIQCP can be a supersymmetric critical
point. We finally show that the low-temperature phase diagram can provide
distinct experimental evidences to detect this FIQCP.

velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are
extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are
computed by CCF with a numerical mask. Aims. The aim of this study is
three-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply
the new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV
data set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved
by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star
observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO
archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero
points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs
of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is < 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL
RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three
significant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software
used for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1
m/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical
timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few
m/s. In addition, we find small (< 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in
DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm
that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly
depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type
stars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be
retrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000
RVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP
corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.

thoroughly studied due to their novel two-dimensional structure, that is
associated with exceptional optical and transport properties. From a
computational point of view, Density Functional Theory simulations perform very
well in these systems and are an indispensable tool to predict and complement
experimental results. However, due to the time and length scales where even the
most efficient DFT implementations can reach today, this methodology suffers of
stringent limitations to deal with finite temperature simulations or
electron-lattice coupling when studying excitation states: the unit cells
required to study, for instance, systems with thermal fluctuations or large
polarons would require a large computational power. Multi-scale techniques,
like the recently proposed Second Principles Density Functional Theory, can go
beyond these limitations but require the construction of tight-binding models
for the systems under investigation. In this work, we compare two such methods

nanostructures is important for fundamental studies of material properties as
well as for quantum information processing with electron, hole, and
nuclear-spin states. Through a combination of first-principles
density-functional theory (DFT) and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory, we have
calculated hyperfine tensors for electrons and holes in GaAs and crystalline
silicon. Accounting for relativistic effects near the nuclear core, we find
contact hyperfine interactions for electrons in GaAs that are consistent with
Knight-shift measurements performed on GaAs quantum wells and are roughly
consistent with prior estimates extrapolated from measurements on InSb. We find
that a combination of DFT and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory is necessary
to accurately determine the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons at a
conduction-band minimum in silicon that is consistent with bulk Knight-shift
measurements. For hole spins in GaAs, the overall magnitude of the hyperfine
couplings we find from DFT is consistent with previous theory based on
free-atom properties, and with heavy-hole Overhauser shifts measured in GaAs
(and InGaAs) quantum dots. In addition, we theoretically predict that the
heavy-hole hyperfine coupling to the As nuclear spins is stronger and almost
purely Ising-like, while the (weaker) coupling to the Ga nuclear spins has
significant non-Ising corrections. In the case of hole spins in silicon, we
find (surprisingly) that the strength of the hyperfine interaction in the
valence band is comparable to that in the conduction band and that the
hyperfine tensors are highly anisotropic (Ising-like) in the heavy-hole
subspace. These results suggest that the hyperfine coupling cannot be ruled out

adopt a flexible skew-normal DTD model, which could match a wide range of
physically motivated DTD forms. We find a family of solutions that are
essentially exponential DTDs, similar in shape to the $\beta\approx-1$
power-law DTDs, but with more delayed events (>1 Gyr in age) than prompt events
(<1 Gyr). Comparing these solutions to delay time measures separately derived
from field galaxies and galaxy clusters, we find the skew-normal solutions can
accommodate both without requiring a different DTD form in different

  Assistant","  People are becoming increasingly comfortable using Digital Assistants (DAs)
to interact with services or connected objects. However, for non-programming
users, the available possibilities for customizing their DA are limited and do
not include the possibility of teaching the assistant new tasks. To make the
most of the potential of DAs, users should be able to customize assistants by
instructing them through Natural Language (NL). To provide such
functionalities, NL interpretation in traditional assistants should be
improved: (1) The intent identification system should be able to recognize new
forms of known intents, and to acquire new intents as they are expressed by the
user. (2) In order to be adaptive to novel intents, the Natural Language
Understanding module should be sample efficient, and should not rely on a
pretrained model. Rather, the system should continuously collect the training
data as it learns new intents from the user. In this work, we propose AidMe
(Adaptive Intent Detection in Multi-Domain Environments), a user-in-the-loop
adaptive intent detection framework that allows the assistant to adapt to its
user by learning his intents as their interaction progresses. AidMe builds its
repertoire of intents and collects data to train a model of semantic similarity
evaluation that can discriminate between the learned intents and autonomously
discover new forms of known intents. AidMe addresses two major issues - intent
learning and user adaptation - for instructable digital assistants. We
demonstrate the capabilities of AidMe as a standalone system by comparing it
with a one-shot learning system and a pretrained NLU module through simulations
of interactions with a user. We also show how AidMe can smoothly integrate to
an existing instructable digital assistant.

focuses on the classical aspects. We derive the complete and simplified form of
the purely gravitational action up to the 6-derivative terms. We also derive
the equivalent forms of the action, which might prove useful in different
applications, namely Riemann- and Weyl-dominated representations. The spectral
action provides a rather rigid structure of the higher derivative part of the
theory. We discuss the possible consequences of this rigidness. As one of the
applications, we check whether the conformal backgrounds are preferred in some
way on the classical level, with the conclusion that at this level, there is no
obvious reason for such a preference, the space $S^1 \times S^3$ studied in
earlier works being a special case. Some other possible properties of the
higher derivative gravity given by the spectral action are briefly discussed.

molecular electronics, then discuss different theoretical approaches. We then
focus on Green's function methods. Two characteristic energy scales governing
the physics are many-body interactions within the junctions, and
molecule-contact coupling. We therefore discuss weak interactions and weak
coupling, as two limits that can be conveniently treated within, respectively,
the standard nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method and its many-body
flavors (pseudoparticle and Hubbard NEGF). We argue that the intermediate
regime, where the two energy scales are comparable, can in many cases be
efficiently treated within the recently introduced superperturbation dual
fermion approach. Finally, we review approaches for going beyond these
analytically accessible limits, as embodied by recent developments in
numerically exact methods based on Green's functions.

  Submillimeter Properties of X-ray Sources in the CDF-S","  The CDF-S is the deepest X-ray image available and will remain so for the
near future. We provide a spectroscopic (64.5%; 64% with spectral
classifications) and photometric redshift catalog for the full 7 Ms sample, but
much of our analysis focuses on the central (off-axis angles <5.7') region,
which contains a large, faint ALMA sample of 75 >4.5-sigma 850 micron sources.
We measure the 850 micron fluxes at the X-ray positions using the ALMA images,
where available, or an ultradeep SCUBA-2 map. We find that the full X-ray
sample produces ~10% of the 850 micron extragalactic background light. We
separate the submillimeter detected X-ray sources into star-forming galaxies
and AGNs using a star formation rate (SFR) versus X-ray luminosity calibration
for high SFR galaxies. We confirm this separation using the X-ray photon
indices. We measure the X-ray fluxes at the accurate positions of the 75 ALMA
sources and detect 70% at >3-sigma in either the 0.5-2 or 2-7 keV bands.
However, many of these may produce both their X-ray and submillimeter emission
by star formation. Indeed, we find that only 20% of the ALMA sources have
intermediate X-ray luminosities (rest-frame 8-28 keV luminosities of
10^42.5-10^44 erg/s), and none has a high X-ray luminosity (>10^44 erg/s).
Conversely, after combining the CDF-S with the CDF-N, we find extreme star
formation (SFR>300 solar masses per yr) in some intermediate X-ray luminosity
sources but not in any high X-ray luminosity sources. We argue that the
quenching of star formation in the most luminous AGNs may be a consequence of
the clearing of gas in these sources.

  Implications for pulsars and FRBs","  Young pulsars and the pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) or supernova remnants (SNRs)
that surround them are some of the most dynamic and high-powered environments
in our Universe. With the rise of more sensitive observations, the number of
pulsar-SNR and PWN associations (hereafter, SNR/PWN) has increased, yet we do
not understand to which extent this environment influences the pulsars'
impulsive radio signals. We studied the dispersive contribution of SNRs and
PWNe on Galactic pulsars, and considered their relevance to fast radio bursts
(FRBs) such as FRB 121102. We investigated the dispersion measure (DM)
contribution of SNRs and PWNe by comparing the measured DMs of Galactic pulsars
in a SNR/PWN to the DM expected only from the intervening interstellar
electrons, using the NE2001 model. We find that a two-$\sigma$ DM contribution
of SNRs and PWNe to the pulsar signal exists, amounting to $21.1 \pm 10.6$ pc
cm$^{-3}$. The control sample of pulsars unassociated with a SNR/PWN shows no
excess. We model the SNR and PWN electron densities for each young pulsar in
our sample and show that these indeed predict an excess of this magnitude. By
extrapolating to the kind of fast-spinning, high magnetic field, young pulsars
that may power FRBs, we show their SNR and PWN are capable of significantly
contributing to the observed DM.

and transmission of data via wireless networks. This type of network is
nowadays used in many applications for surveillance activities in various
environments due to its low cost and easy communications. In these networks,
the sensors use a limited power source which after its depletion, since it is
non-renewable, network lifetime ends. Due to the weaknesses in sensor nodes,
they are vulnerable to many threats. One notable attack threating WSN is Denial
of Sleep (DoS). DoS attacks denotes the loss of energy in these sensors by
keeping the nodes from going into sleep and energy-saving mode. In this paper,
the Abnormal Sensor Detection Accuracy (ASDA-RSA) method is utilised to
counteract DoS attacks to reducing the amount of energy consumed. The ASDA-RSA
schema in this paper consists of two phases to enhancement security in the
WSNs. In the first phase, a clustering approach based on energy and distance is
used to select the proper cluster head and in the second phase, the RSA
cryptography algorithm and interlock protocol are used here along with an
authentication method, to prevent DoS attacks. Moreover, ASDA-RSA method is
evaluated here via extensive simulations carried out in NS-2. The simulation
results indicate that the WSN network performance metrics are improved in terms
of average throughput, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), network lifetime, detection
ratio, and average residual energy.

using the X-ray afterglows of 18 short gamma-ray bursts. We then apply
hierarchical inference to infer properties of the neutron star equation of
state and dominant spin-down mechanism. We measure the maximum non-rotating
neutron star mass $M_\mathrm{TOV} = 2.31 ^{+0.36}_{-0.21} M_{\odot}$ and
constrain the fraction of remnants spinning down predominantly through
gravitational-wave emission to $\eta = 0.69 ^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ with $68 \%$
uncertainties. In principle, this method can determine the difference between
hadronic and quark equation of states. In practice, however, the data is not
yet informative with indications that these neutron stars do not have hadronic
equation of states at the $1\sigma$ level. These inferences all depend on the
underlying progenitor mass distribution for short gamma-ray bursts produced by
binary neutron star mergers. The recently announced gravitational-wave
detection of GW190425 suggests this underlying distribution is different from
the locally-measured population of double neutron stars. We show that
$M_\mathrm{TOV}$ and $\eta$ constraints depend on the fraction of binary
mergers that form through a distribution consistent with the locally-measured
population and a distribution that can explain GW190425. The more binaries that
form from the latter distribution, the larger $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ needs to be to
satisfy the X-ray observations. Our measurements above are marginalised over
this unknown fraction. If instead, we assume GW190425 is not a binary neutron
star merger, i.e the underlying mass distribution of double neutron stars is

Poisson-Lognormal distribution (PLN), and the Poisson-Lognormal distribution
with a bias parameter (PLNB) are compared to simulations. The fits agree
reasonably consistently over a range of redshifts and scales. To distinguish
quintessence (RPCDM) and phantom ($w$CDM) dark energy from $\Lambda$ dark

on larger scales. For cosmologies explored in the DEUS simulations, the
percentage differences between these statistics for the RPCDM and $w$CDM dark

has been regarded as an indirect support of alternative theories of gravity
such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and modified gravity. This relation
indicates a tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass in
galaxies with different sizes and morphology. However, if the RAR relation is
scale-independent and could be explained by alternative theories of gravity,
this relation should be universal and true for galaxy clusters as well. In this
article, by using the x-ray data of a sample of galaxy clusters, we investigate
if there exists any tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass
in galaxy clusters, assuming hot gas mass distribution almost representing
baryonic distribution and that the galaxy clusters are virialized. We show that
the resulting RAR of 52 non-cool-core galaxy clusters scatters in a large
parameter space, possibly due to our simplifying assumptions and unclear matter
content in galaxy clusters. This might indicate that the RAR is unlikely to be
universal and scale-independent.

restrict ourselves to the non-relativistic regime of velocities wherein mainly
Doppler shift effects are significant. For our studies, we consider the
scattering on a two-level atom, including the effects of partial frequency
redistribution (PFR). We present the dependence of linearly polarized profiles
on different atmospheric and atomic parameters.

  and subgiant stars. VII. Lithium","  Lithium abundances are presented for 91 dwarf and subgiant stars in the
Galactic bulge. The analysis is based on line synthesis of the 7Li line at 6707
{\AA} in high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensing
events, when the brightnesses of the targets were highly magnified. Our main
finding is that the bulge stars at sub-solar metallicities, and that are older
than about eight billion years, does not show any sign of Li production, that
is, the Li trend with metallicity is flat (or even slightly declining). This
indicates that no lithium was produced during the first few billion years in
the history of the bulge. This finding is essentially identical to what is seen
for the (old) thick disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, and adds another
piece of evidence for a tight connection between the metal-poor bulge and the
Galactic thick disk. For the bulge stars younger than about eight billion
years, the sample contains a group of stars at very high metallicities at
[Fe/H]~+0.4 that have lithium abundances in the range A(Li)=2.6-2.8. In the
Solar neighbourhood the lithium abundances have been found to peak at a
A(Li)~3.3 at [Fe/H]~ +0.1 and then decrease by 0.4-0.5 dex when reaching
[Fe/H]~+0.4. The few bulge stars that we have at these metallicities, seem to
support this declining A(Li) trend. This could indeed support the recent claim
that the low A(Li) abundances at the highest metallicities seen in the Solar
neighbourhood could be due to stars from the inner disk, or the bulge region,
that have migrated to the Solar neighbourhood.

  switching","  Future information technology demands ultimately fast, low-loss quantum
control. Intense light fields have facilitated important milestones, such as
inducing novel states of matter, accelerating electrons ballistically, or
coherently flipping the valley pseudospin. These dynamics leave unique
signatures, such as characteristic bandgaps or high-order harmonic radiation.
The fastest and least dissipative way of switching the technologically most
important quantum attribute - the spin - between two states separated by a
potential barrier is to trigger an all-coherent precession. Pioneering
experiments and theory with picosecond electric and magnetic fields have
suggested this possibility, yet observing the actual dynamics has remained out
of reach. Here, we show that terahertz (1 THz = 10$^{12}$ Hz) electromagnetic
pulses allow coherent navigation of spins over a potential barrier and we
reveal the corresponding temporal and spectral fingerprints. This goal is
achieved by coupling spins in antiferromagnetic TmFeO$_{3}$ with the locally
enhanced THz electric field of custom-tailored antennas. Within their duration
of 1 ps, the intense THz pulses abruptly change the magnetic anisotropy and
trigger a large-amplitude ballistic spin motion. A characteristic phase flip,
an asymmetric splitting of the magnon resonance, and a long-lived offset of the
Faraday signal are hallmarks of coherent spin switching into adjacent potential
minima, in agreement with a numerical simulation. The switchable spin states
can be selected by an external magnetic bias. The low dissipation and the
antenna's sub-wavelength spatial definition could facilitate scalable spin
devices operating at THz rates.

of these energy windows can be understood using a two-band model of the

and disordered itinerant ferromagnets with pair exchange interactions derived
from a method of infinitesimal spin rotations. The resulting formula bears an
explicit form of a linear-response coefficient which involves one-particle
Green's functions and effective velocity operators encountered in a recent
theory of electron transport. Application of this approach to ideal metal
crystals yields more reliable values of the spin stiffness than traditional
ill-convergent real-space lattice summations. The formalism can also be
combined with the coherent potential approximation for an effective-medium
treatment of random alloys, which leads naturally to an inclusion of
disorder-induced vertex corrections to the spin stiffness. The calculated
concentration dependence of the spin-wave stiffness of random fcc Ni-Fe alloys
can be ascribed to a variation of the reciprocal value of alloy magnetization.
Calculations for random iron-rich bcc Fe-Al alloys reveal that their spin-wave
stiffness is strongly reduced owing to the atomic ordering; this effect takes
place due to weakly coupled local magnetic moments of Fe atoms surrounded by a
reduced number of Fe nearest neighbors.

ecological systems, as these might not be able to adapt or to migrate at the
same pace as that of global warming. In particular, an increase of weather and
climate extremes can lead to increased stress on human and natural systems, and
a tendency for serious adverse effects. We rely on the EURO-CORDEX simulations
and focus on the the screen-level daily mean temperature (T2m). We compare the
shifting velocities of the cold and hot extremes with these of the associated
central trends, i.e., the arithmetical mean or median. We define the extremes
relative to the T2m distribution as it evolves with time over the period of
1951--2100. We find that temperature extremes shift at a similar velocity
compared to that of the central trends. Accordingly, the T2m probability
distribution shifts mostly as a whole, as the tails of the distribution
increase together with the central trends. Exceptions occur however in specific
regions and for the clustering of warm days, which shifts slower than all other
extremes investigated in this study.

how and when these disks are formed, it is crucial to characterize the
kinematics of the youngest protostars at a high angular resolution. Here we
study a sample of 16 Class 0 protostars to measure their rotation profile at
scales from 50 to 500~au and search for Keplerian rotation. We used
high-angular-resolution line observations obtained with the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer as part of the CALYPSO large program. From $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$
($J=2-1$), $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ ($J=2-1$) and SO ($N_{j}=5_{6}-4_{5}$) moment
maps, we find that seven sources show rotation about the jet axis at a few
hundred au scales: SerpS-MM18, L1448-C, L1448-NB, L1527, NGC1333- IRAS2A,
NGC1333-IRAS4B, and SVS13-B. We analyzed the kinematics of these sources in the
$uv$ plane to derive the rotation profiles down to 50~au scales. We find
evidence for Keplerian rotation in only two sources, L1527 and L1448-C.
Overall, this suggests that Keplerian disks larger than 50 au are uncommon
around Class 0 protostars. However, in some of the sources, the line emission
could be optically thick and dominated by the envelope emission. Due to the
optical thickness of these envelopes, some of the disks could have remained
undetected in our observations.

blind narrow-band Halpha+[NII] imaging survey of the Virgo cluster carried out
with MegaCam at the Canada-French-Hawaii telescope (CFHT). We use a new set of
data extracted from VESTIGE to study the impact of the hostile cluster
environment on the star formation process down to the scale of HII regions (~
50 pc). HII regions are identified and their parameters measured using the
HIIphot code on a sample of 114 late-type galaxies spanning a wide range in
morphological type (Sa-Sd, Im, BCD), stellar mass (10^6.5 <= M_star <= 10^11
Mo), and star formation activity (10^-3 <= SFR <= 10 Mo yr^-1). Owing to the
exquisite average resolution of the VESTIGE data (0.65 arcsec), we detect 11302
HII regions with an Halpha luminosity L(Halpha) >= 10^37 erg s^-1. We show that
the typical number of HII regions in gas-stripped objects is significantly
lower than in healthy late-types of similar stellar mass. We also show that in
these gas-stripped galaxies the number of HII regions significantly drops
outside the effective radius, suggesting that the quenching process occurs
outside-in, in agreement with other multifrequency observations. These new
results consistently confirm that the main mechanism responsible for the
decrease of the star formation activity observed in cluster galaxies is ram
pressure, allowing us to discard other milder processes such as starvation or
strangulation unable to reproduce the observed radially truncated profiles.

configuration space doesn't grow exponentially as a function of the degrees of
freedom. The use of scaling expansions is a natural way to measure the
asymptotic growth of the configuration space volume in terms of the scaling
exponents of the system. These scaling exponents can, in turn, be used to
define universality classes that uniquely determine the statistics of a system.
Every system belongs to one of these classes. Here we derive the information
geometry of scaling expansions of sample spaces. In particular, we present the
deformed logarithms and the metric in a systematic and coherent way. We observe
a phase transition for the curvature. The phase transition can be well measured
by the characteristic length r, corresponding to a ball with radius 2r having
the same curvature as the statistical manifold. Increasing characteristic
length with respect to the size of the system is associated with
sub-exponential sample space growth is associated with strongly constrained and
correlated complex systems. Decreasing of the characteristic length corresponds
to super-exponential sample space growth that occurs for example in systems
that develop structure as they evolve. Constant curvature means exponential
sample space growth that is associated with multinomial statistics, and
traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs, or Shannon statistics applies. This allows us to
characterize transitions between statistical manifolds corresponding to
different families of probability distributions.

towards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 (IRAS16293). We
utilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of

results from the other binary component, which have already been published. We
detect 15 different COM, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous
companion protostar IRAS16293 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11
isotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first
detections of CH3OCH2OH and t-C2H5OCH3 towards IRAS16293 B and the follow-up
detection of CH2DCHO and CH3CDO. Twenty-four lines of CHD2OH are also

shows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are
partially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is
consistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher
expected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the
hot corino towards IRAS16293 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in
IRAS16293 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In
parallel, the list of identified CHD2OH lines shows the need of accurate

helical magnetic field or motion of the radiating plasma along a spiral path.
Apparent speeds of emission knots range from 10 to 37c, with the highest values
requiring bulk Lorentz factors close to those needed to explain $\gamma$-ray
variability on very short time scales. The Mg II emission line flux in the
`blue' and `red' wings correlates with the optical synchrotron continuum flux
density, possibly providing a variable source of seed photons for inverse
Compton scattering. In the radio bands we find progressive delays of the most
prominent light curve maxima with decreasing frequency, as expected from the
frequency dependence of the $\tau=1$ surface of synchrotron self-absorption.
The global maximum in the 86 GHz light curve becomes less prominent at lower
frequencies, while a local maximum, appearing in 2014, strengthens toward
decreasing frequencies, becoming pronounced at $\sim5$ GHz. These tendencies
suggest different Doppler boosting of stratified radio-emitting zones in the

\ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ with $\ell=e$ or $\mu$ in the Standard Model. The
branching fractions and forward-backward asymmetries, defined in terms of the
flight direction of the photon relative to the lepton momenta, depend on the
cuts on energies and invariant masses of the final state particles. For typical
choices of these cuts we find the branching ratios $B(H\to e \bar e
\gamma)=6.1\cdot 10^{-5}$ and $B(H\to \mu \bar \mu \gamma)=6.7\cdot 10^{-5}$
and the forward-backward asymmetries $\mathcal{A}^{(e)}_{\text{FB}}=0.366$ and
$\mathcal{A}^{(\mu)}_{\text{FB}}=0.280$. We provide compact analytic
expressions for the differential decay rates for the use in experimental
analyses.

by data"". In this book a story is told about the psychological traits
associated with drug consumption. The book includes:
  - A review of published works on the psychological profiles of drug users.
  - Analysis of a new original database with information on 1885 respondents
and usage of 18 drugs. (Database is available online.)
  - An introductory description of the data mining and machine learning methods
used for the analysis of this dataset.
  - The demonstration that the personality traits (five factor model,
impulsivity, and sensation seeking), together with simple demographic data,
give the possibility of predicting the risk of consumption of individual drugs
with sensitivity and specificity above 70% for most drugs.
  - The analysis of correlations of use of different substances and the
description of the groups of drugs with correlated use (correlation pleiades).
  - Proof of significant differences of personality profiles for users of
different drugs. This is explicitly proved for benzodiazepines, ecstasy, and
heroin.
  - Tables of personality profiles for users and non-users of 18 substances.
  The book is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as
well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of machine
learning, advanced data mining concepts or modern psychology of personality is
assumed. For more detailed introduction into statistical methods we recommend
several undergraduate textbooks. Familiarity with basic statistics and some
experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful as well as some basic
technical understanding of psychology.

2001.06524v1,2020-01-17,2020-01-17,Fermi surfaces of composite fermions,"  The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect was discovered in two-dimensional
electron systems subject to a large perpendicular magnetic field nearly four
decades ago. It helped launch the field of topological phases, and in addition,
because of the quenching of the kinetic energy, gave new meaning to the phrase
""correlated matter"". Most FQH phases are gapped like insulators and
superconductors; however, a small subset with even denominator fractional
fillings nu of the Landau level, typified by nu = 1/2, are found to be gapless,
with a Fermi surface akin to metals. We discuss our results, obtained
numerically using the infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG)
scheme, on the effect of non-isotropic distortions with discrete N-fold
rotational symmetry of the Fermi surface at zero magnetic field on the Fermi
surface of the correlated nu = 1/2 state. We find that while the response for N
= 2 (elliptical) distortions is significant (and in agreement with experimental
observations with no adjustable parameters), it decreases very rapidly as N is
increased. Other anomalies, like resilience to breaking the Fermi surface into
disjoint pieces, are also found. This highlights the difference between Fermi
surfaces formed from the kinetic energy, and those formed of purely potential
energy terms in the Hamiltonian.

2001.06542v1,2020-01-17,2020-01-17,Finite-size scaling analysis of protein droplet formation,"  The formation of biomolecular condensates inside cells often involve
intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and several of these IDPs are also
capable of forming droplet-like dense assemblies on their own, through
liquid-liquid phase separation. When modelings thermodynamic phase changes, it
is well-known that finite-size scaling analysis can be a valuable tool.
However, to our knowledge, this approach has not been applied before to the
computationally challenging problem of modeling sequence-dependent biomolecular
phase separation. Here, we implement finite-size scaling methods to investigate
the phase behavior of two 10-bead sequences in a continuous hydrophobic/polar
protein model. Combined with reversible explicit-chain Monte Carlo simulations
of these sequences, finite-size scaling analysis turns out to be both feasible
and rewarding, despite relying on theoretical results for asymptotically large
systems. While both sequences form dense clusters at low temperature, this
analysis shows that only one of them undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation.
Furthermore, the transition temperature at which droplet formation sets in, is
observed to converge slowly with system size, so that even for our largest
systems the transition is shifted by about 8%. Using finite-size scaling
analysis, this shift can be estimated and corrected for.

2001.06569v1,2020-01-18,2020-01-18,"Temporally Varying Universal Gravitational ""Constant"" and Speed of Light
  in Energy Momentum Squared Gravity","  Energy Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) is a cosmological model where the
scale factor is non vanishing at all times and hence does not favor big bang
cosmology. However, the profile of density in the radiation dominated universe
shows that EMSG supports inflationary cosmology. Inflationary cosmological
models are successful in providing convincing answers to major cosmological
issues like horizon problem, flatness problem and small value of cosmological
constant but hitherto no model of inflation has been observationally confirmed.
Owing to this, Varying Speed of Light (VSL) were introduced which are a class
of cosmological models which disfavor inflation and propose an alternative
route to solve these cosmological issues by just allowing the speed of light
(and Newtonian Gravitational constant) to vary. VSL theories were motivated to
address the shortcomings of inflation but do not address the shortcomings
related to the initial big bang singularity. In this spirit, we present here a
novel cosmological model which is free from both the ""initial big bang
singularity"" and ""inflation"" by incorporating a mutually varying speed of light
$c(t)$ and Newtonian gravitational constant $G(t)$ in the framework of EMSG. We
report that in EMSG, for a dust universe ($\omega=0$), cosmological models for
a time varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ and constant $c$ and $G$ are
indistinguishable, whereas for a radiation dominated universe ($\omega = 1/3$),
a mutually varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ provides an exiting alternative to
inflationary cosmology which is also free from initial big bang singularity. We
further report that for an ansatz of scale factor representing a bouncing
cosmological model, the VSL theory can be applied to a quadratic $T$ gravity
model to get rid of ""inflation"" and ""big bang singularity"" and concurrently
solve the above mentioned cosmological enigmas.

2001.06577v3,2020-01-18,2020-01-18,Geometric Dark Matter,"  The dark matter, needed for various phenomena ranging from flat rotation
curves to structure formation, seems to be not only neutral and long-living but
also highly secluded from the ordinary matter. Here we show that, metric-affine
gravity, which involves metric tensor and affine connection as two independent
fields, dynamically reduces, in its minimal form, to the usual gravity plus a
massive vector field. The vector, which interacts with only the quarks, leptons
and gravity, is neutral and long-living (longer than the age of the Universe)
when its mass range is $9.4\ {\rm MeV} < M_Y < 28.4\ {\rm MeV}$. Its scattering
cross section from nucleons, which is some 60 orders of magnitude below the
current bounds, is too small to facilitate direct detection of the dark matter.
This property provides an explanation for whys and hows of dark matter
searches. We show that due to its geometrical origin the $Y_\mu$ does not
couple to scalars and gauge bosons. It couples only to fermions. This very
feature of the $Y_\mu$ makes it fundamentally different than all the other
vector dark matter candidates in the literature. The geometrical dark matter we
present is minimal and self-consistent not only theoretically but also
astrophysically in that its feebly interacting nature is all that is needed for
its longevity.

  the structure of a starburst nucleus at z = 3.63","  Submillimeter rotational lines of H2O are a powerful probe in warm gas
regions of the ISM, tracing scales and structures ranging from kpc disks to the
most compact and dust-obscured regions of galactic nuclei. The
ortho-H2O(423-330) line at 448 GHz, which was recently detected in a local
luminous infrared galaxy (Pereira-Santaella et al. 2017), offers a unique
constraint on the excitation conditions and ISM properties in deeply buried
galaxy nuclei since the line requires high far-IR optical depths to be excited.
In this letter, we report the first high-redshift detection of the 448 GHz
H2O(423-330) line using ALMA, in a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG)
at z=3.63. After correcting for magnification, the luminosity of the 448 GHz
H2O line is ~10^6 L_sun. In combination with three other previously detected
H2O lines, we build a model that ""resolves"" the dusty ISM structure of the SMG,
and find that it is composed of a ~1 kpc optically thin (optical depth at
100{\mu}m {\tau}_{100}~0.3) disk component with dust temperature T_{dust}
\approx 50 K emitting a total infrared power of 5e12 L_sun with surface density
\Sigma_{IR}=4e11 L_sun kpc^{-2}, and a very compact (0.1 kpc) heavily
dust-obscured ({\tau}_{100} \gtrsim 1) nuclear core with very warm dust (100 K)
and \Sigma_{IR}=8e12 L_sun kpc^{-2}. The H2O abundance in the core component,
X_{H2O}~(0.3-5)e{-5}, is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the
disk component. The optically thick core has the characteristic properties of
an Eddington-limited starburst, providing evidence that radiation pressure on
dust is capable of supporting the ISM in buried nuclei at high redshifts. The
multi-component ISM structure revealed by our models illustrates that dust and
molecules such as H2O are present in regions characterized by highly differing
conditions and scales, extending from the nucleus to more extended regions of
SMGs.

polarizations associated with the plane-wave components experience slightly
different rotations in order to satisfy the transversality after reflection or

opportunities to reexamine the spin-orbit interaction of light at the unique
optical interface. Here, we establish a general model to describe the
spin-orbit interaction of light in the photonic Dirac metacrystal. We find a
giant photonic spin Hall effect near the Dirac points when a Gaussian beam
impinges at the interface of the photonic Dirac metacrystal. The giant photonic
spin Hall effect is attribute to the strong spin-orbit interaction of light,
which manifests itself as the large polarization rotations of different
plane-wave components. We believe that these results may provide insight into
the fundamental properties of the spin-orbit interaction of light in the
topological photonic systems.

possible (with $n_s$ and $r$ close to the above expressions). We derive the

that are generally around the inflationary Hubble scale. Finally, we show that

the data-processing pipeline of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio
Telescope (FAST). Because of its high sensitivity and large data rate, FAST
requires more accurate and efficient RFI flagging methods than its
counterparts. In the last decades, approaches based upon artificial
intelligence (AI), such as codes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
have been proposed to identify RFI more reliably and efficiently. However, RFI
flagging of FAST data with such methods has often proved to be erroneous, with
further manual inspections required. In addition, network construction as well
as preparation of training data sets for effective RFI flagging has imposed
significant additional workloads. Therefore, rapid deployment and adjustment of
AI approaches for different observations is impractical to implement with
existing algorithms. To overcome such problems, we propose a model called
RFI-Net. With the input of raw data without any processing, RFI-Net can detect
RFI automatically, producing corresponding masks without any alteration of the
original data. Experiments with RFI-Net using simulated astronomical data show
that our model has outperformed existing methods in terms of both precision and
recall. Besides, compared with other models, our method can obtain the same
relative accuracy with fewer training data, thus reducing the effort and time
required to prepare the training data set. Further, the training process of
RFI-Net can be accelerated, with overfittings being minimized, compared with
other CNN codes. The performance of RFI-Net has also been evaluated with
observing data obtained by FAST and the Bleien Observatory. Our results
demonstrate the ability of RFI-Net to accurately identify RFI with
fine-grained, high-precision masks that required no further modification.

  candidates FePd$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Mo$_3$N","  Ferromagnets crystallizing in structures described by chiral cubic space
groups, including compounds with the B20 or $\beta$-Mn structures, are known to
host long-period chiral spin textures such as skyrmion lattices. These spin
textures are stabilized by a competition between ferromagnetic exchange and
antisymmetric Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange, which is enhanced by the
spin-orbit coupling associated with high-atomic-number elements. For real-world
application, it is desirable to find materials that can host compact skyrmion
lattices at readily accessible temperatures. Here, we report on the crystal
chemistry and magnetic phase diagrams of a family of compounds with the filled
$\beta$-Mn structure, FePd$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Mo$_3$N with $T_C$ ranging from 175 K
to 240 K. DC and AC magnetization measurements reveal magnetic phase diagrams
consistent with the formation of a skyrmion pocket just below $T_C$. The
magnitudes of ferromagnetic and DM exchanges are determined from the phase
diagrams, demonstrating that the introduction of increasing amounts of Pt can
be used to increase spin-orbit coupling in order to control the expected
skyrmion lattice parameter between 140 nm and 65 nm while simultaneously
increasing $T_C$.

as $\mathcal{O}(E^6)$, we identify regions of the parameter space where they
are softened to $\mathcal{O}(E^4)$ or even $\mathcal{O}(E^3)$, which allows for
a larger validity range of the effective theory. In these regions, both
positivity and beyond-positivity of the forward Compton amplitudes are
fulfilled, and the equivalence principle automatically emerges.

of WASP-121b reveals the absorption signature from metals, likely atomic iron,
in the planet atmospheric limb. The width of the signal (14.3$\pm$1.2 km/s) can
be explained by the rotation of the tidally locked planet. Its blueshift

or the anisotropic expansion of the planetary thermosphere.

2001.08087v1,2020-01-19,2020-01-19,Cold gas and dust: Hunting spiral-like structures in early-type galaxies,"  Observations of neutral hydrogen (HI) and molecular gas show that 50% of all
nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) contain some cold gas. Molecular gas is
always found in small gas discs in the central region of the galaxy, while
neutral hydrogen is often distributed in a low-column density disc or ring
typically extending well beyond the stellar body. Dust is frequently found in
ETGs as well. The goal of our study is to understand the link between dust and
cold gas in nearby ETGs as a function of HI content. We analyse deep optical
$g-r$ images obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope for a sample of 21 HI-rich and 41 HI-poor ETGs. We find that all
HI-rich galaxies contain dust seen as absorption. Moreover, in 57 percent of
these HI-rich galaxies, the dust is distributed in a large-scale spiral
pattern. Although the dust detection rate is relatively high in the HI-poor
galaxies ($\sim$59 percent), most of these systems exhibit simpler dust
morphologies without any evidence of spiral structures. We find that the
HI-rich galaxies possess more complex dust morphology extending to almost two
times larger radii than HI-poor objects. We measured the dust content of the
galaxies from the optical colour excess and find that HI-rich galaxies contain
six times more dust (in mass) than HI-poor ones. In order to maintain the dust
structures in the galaxies, continuous gas accretion is needed, and the
substantial HI gas reservoirs in the outer regions of ETGs can satisfy this
need for a long time. We find that there is a good correspondence between the
observed masses of the gas and dust, and it is also clear that dust is present
in regions further than 3~Reff. Our findings indicate an essential relation
between the presence of cold gas and dust in ETGs and offer a way to study the
interstellar medium in more detail than what is possible with HI observations.

2001.06873v1,2020-01-19,2020-01-19,K-essence scalar dark matter solitons around supermassive black holes,"  We consider scalar dark matter models where the theory has a shift symmetry
only broken by the scalar mass term. We restrict ourselves to K-essence kinetic
terms where the shift symmetric part of the Lagrangian is a function of the
first derivatives of the scalar field only. In the low-amplitude and
nonrelativistic regime, which applies on large galactic scales, scalar clouds
form solitons with a finite core. Close to the center of galaxies, where a
supermassive Black Hole (BH) resides, we analyze the scalar field distribution
and the fate of the dark matter soliton when subject to the BH gravitational
attraction. We show that the scalar field profile around such a central BH can
be described by new oscillatory solutions of a modified Klein-Gordon equation,
which generalize the harmonic oscillations of free scalar dark matter in a flat
environment and the Jacobi elliptic functions of the $\phi^4$ model. Moreover,
we find that, depending on the form of the K-essence kinetic term, regular
solutions can be constructed or not, which connect the relativistic ingoing
wavelike profile of the scalar field at the BH horizon to the nearly static
nonrelativistic soliton at large distance. These profiles have a constant flux
and represent the slow infall of scalar matter into the BH. We show that this
regular behavior is only possible for K-essence functions that satisfy the
usual conditions for the absence of ghosts and gradient instabilities, together
with a new restriction on the growth of the kinetic function $K(X)$ for large
argument. It turns out that the same conditions of stability guarantee that
quantum corrections are tamed, provided that the mass of the scalar field is
less than $10^{-3}$ eV and the strong coupling scale of the model $\Lambda$ is
much larger than the scalar mass.

2001.06926v3,2020-01-20,2020-01-20,Supernova Magnitude Evolution and PAge Approximation,"  The evidence of environmental dependence of Type Ia supernova luminosity has
inspired recent discussion about whether the late-universe cosmic acceleration
is still supported by supernova data. We adopt the
$\Delta\mathrm{HR}/\Delta\mathrm{age}$ parameter, which describes the
dependence of supernova absolute magnitude on the age of supernova progenitor,
as an additional nuisance parameter. Using the Pantheon supernova data, a lower
bound $\ge 12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ on the cosmic age, and a Gaussian prior $H_0 =
70\pm 2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ on the Hubble constant, we reconstruct
the cosmic expansion history. Within the flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter
($\Lambda$CDM) framework, we still find a $5.6\sigma$ detection of cosmic
acceleration. This is because a matter dominated decelerating universe would be
too young to accommodate observed old stars with age $\gtrsim
12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. A decelerating but non-flat universe is marginally
consistent with the data, however, only in the presence of a negative spatial
curvature $\sim$ two orders of magnitude beyond the current constraint from
cosmic microwave background data. Finally, we propose a more general
Parameterization based on the cosmic Age (PAge), which is {\it not} directly
tied to the dark energy concept and hence is ideal for a null test of the
cosmic acceleration. We find that, for a magnitude evolution rate
$\Delta\mathrm{HR}/\Delta\mathrm{age} \lesssim
0.3\,\mathrm{mag}/5.3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ (Kang et al. 2020), a spatially flat and
decelerating PAge universe is fully consistent with the supernova data and the
cosmic age bound, and has no tension with the geometric constraint from the
observed CMB acoustic angular scales.

wavefunction of a zero-energy state localized near an arbitrary edge. This
method enables us to show that one localized state appears at $E = 0$ if the

states inevitably deviates from $E = 0$ if the edge includes an even number of
corners.

  Active Learning","  When creating text classification systems, one of the major bottlenecks is
the annotation of training data. Active learning has been proposed to address
this bottleneck using stopping methods to minimize the cost of data annotation.
An important capability for improving the utility of stopping methods is to
effectively forecast the performance of the text classification models.
Forecasting can be done through the use of logarithmic models regressed on some
portion of the data as learning is progressing. A critical unexplored question
is what portion of the data is needed for accurate forecasting. There is a
tension, where it is desirable to use less data so that the forecast can be
made earlier, which is more useful, versus it being desirable to use more data,
so that the forecast can be more accurate. We find that when using active
learning it is even more important to generate forecasts earlier so as to make
them more useful and not waste annotation effort. We investigate the difference
in forecasting difficulty when using accuracy and F-measure as the text
classification system performance metrics and we find that F-measure is more
difficult to forecast. We conduct experiments on seven text classification
datasets in different semantic domains with different characteristics and with
three different base machine learning algorithms. We find that forecasting is
easiest for decision tree learning, moderate for Support Vector Machines, and
most difficult for neural networks.

the reheating phase after inflation which is necessary to reheat the universe

spintronics. The realization of such a device requires the use of materials
with unique spin-dependent electronic properties such as half-metallic magnets
(HMMs) and spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs). Quaternary Heusler compounds
offer a unique platform to design within the same family of compounds HMMs and
SGSs with similar lattice constants to make coherent growth of the consecutive
spacers of the device possible. Employing state-of-the-art first-principles
calculations, we scan the quaternary Heusler compounds and identify suitable
candidates for these spintronic devices combining the desirable properties: (i)
HMMs with sizable energy gap or SGSs with spin gaps both below and above the
Fermi level, (ii) high Curie temperature, (iii) convex hull energy distance
less than 0.20 eV, and (iv) negative formation energies. Our results pave the
way for the experimental realization of the proposed magnetic tunnel diodes and

of bars in galaxies with significant gas content focusing on the phenomenon of
the buckling instability. The galaxies are initially composed of a spherical
dark matter halo and only stellar, or stellar and gaseous, disks with
parameters that are similar to the Milky Way and are evolved for 10 Gyr. We
consider different values of the gas fraction $f =0-0.3$ and in order to
isolate the effect of the gas, we kept the fraction constant during the
evolution by not allowing the gas to cool and form stars. The stellar bars that
form in simulations with higher gas fractions are weaker and shorter, and they
do not form at all for gas fractions that are higher than 0.3. The bar with a
gas fraction of 0.1 forms sooner due to initial perturbations in the gas, but
despite the longer evolution, it does not become stronger than the one in the
collisionless case at the end of evolution. The bars in the gas component are
weaker; they reach their maximum strength around 4 Gyr and later decline to
transform into spheroidal shapes. The distortion of the stellar bar during the
buckling instability is weaker for higher gas fractions and weakens the bar
less significantly, but it has a similar structure both in terms of radial
profiles and in face-on projections. For $f=0.2,$ the first buckling lasts
significantly longer and the bar does not undergo the secondary buckling event,
while for $f=0.3,$ the buckling does not occur. Despite these differences, all
bars develop boxy/peanut shapes in the stellar and gas component by the end of
the evolution, although their thickness is smaller for higher gas fractions.

scattering. Using neutron scattering and ab initio calculations, we report here
a mechanism of static local structure distortion combined with
phonon-anharmonic-induced ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in

scattered by the compound's intrinsic distorted rocksalt sublattice, the heat
is mainly transported by the longitudinal acoustic phonons. The ultralow
thermal conductivity in {\alpha}-MgAgSb is attributed to its atomic dynamics
being altered by the structure distortion, which presents a possible
microscopic route to enhance the performance of similar thermoelectric

to exploit the Big Data capabilities of machine learning to detect new open

enable further studies on the Galactic disc. We use a machine learning based
methodology to systematically search in the Galactic disc, looking for
overdensities in the astrometric space and identifying them as open clusters
using photometric information. First, we use an unsupervised clustering
algorithm, DBSCAN, to blindly search for these overdensities in \textit{Gaia}
DR2 $(l,b,\varpi,\mu_{\alpha^*},\mu_\delta)$. After that, we use a deep
learning artificial neural network trained on colour-magnitude diagrams to
identify isochrone patterns in these overdensities, and to confirm them as open
clusters. We find $582$ new open clusters distributed along the Galactic disc,
in the region $|b| < 20$. We can detect substructure in complex regions, and
identify the tidal tails of a disrupting cluster UBC~$274$ of $\sim 3$ Gyr
located at $\sim 2$ kpc. Adapting the methodology into a Big Data environment
allows us to target the search driven by physical properties of the open
clusters, instead of being driven by its computational requirements. This blind
search for open clusters in the Galactic disc increases in a $45\%$ the number
of known open clusters.

understand the magnitude of the impact induced heating and the initially stored
thermal energy of the accreting Moonlets. The main objective of the present
study is to understand the nature of processes leading to core-mantle
differentiation and the production and cooling of the initial convective magma
ocean. The accretion of Moon was commenced over a timescale of 100 years after
the giant impact event around 30-100 million years in the early solar system.
We studied the dependence of the planetary processes on the impact scenarios,
the initial average temperature of the accreting moonlets and the size of the
protoMoon that accreted rapidly beyond the Roche limit within the initial one
year after the giant impact. The simulations indicate that the accreting
Moonlets should have a minimum initial averaged temperature around 1600 K. The
impacts would provide additional thermal energy. The initial thermal state of
the moonlets depends upon the environment prevailing within the Roche limit
that experienced episodes of extensive vaporization and re-condensation of
silicates. The initial convective magma ocean of depth more than 1000 km is
produced in the majority of simulations along with the global core-mantle
differentiation in case the melt percolation of the molten metal through porous
flow from bulk silicates was not the major mode of core-mantle differentiation.
The possibility of shallow magma oceans cannot be ruled out in the presence of
the porous flow. Our simulations indicate the core-mantle differentiation
within the initial $10^2$-$10^3$ years of the Moon accretion. The majority of
the convective magma ocean cooled down for crystallization within the initial
$10^3$-$10^4$ years.

  Behavior in Metal-String Single Molecular Devices","  It is often intriguing experimentally to take stock of how conformational
changes in the device configuration may impact the overall charge transport
behavior of single-molecule junctions. Based on the allied approach of density
functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we explore
here the effect of junction heterogeneity on inelastic charge transport in
various metal-string based single-molecule devices. The constituent active
elements being sensitive to the resonant levels, transition metal centers are
found to influence stretching, bending, and torsional excitation modes, while
rocking and scissoring modes are controlled largely by the axial ligands. For
certain molecular conformations and electrode orientations, phonon-assisted
quantum interference effect may crop up, leading to the suppression of higher
wavenumber vibrational modes. The resulting inelastic spectra are likely to
take the shape of dominant Fano resonance or anti-resonance, depending on
whether phonons are emitted or absorbed. Such nanoscale quantum interference
effect is manifested especially in those metal-string molecular junctions for
which the energy gap (between localized and delocalized virtual states) lies
well within the optical phonon energies ($\Delta{E}_{|HOMO-LUMO|} <$ 40 meV).
It also turns out that single molecular shot noise can exhibit nearly
Poissonian behavior if the inter-channel tunneling through frontier orbitals is
accompanied by phonon absorption or emission following a slow relaxation
process. Our results thus suggest that charge transport properties across
metal-string complexes can be potentially tuned by selective architecture of
the metal centers and also, by preferred orientation of nanoscale electrodes in
a bid to build up molecular devices with desirable controllability.

classical systems can have arbitrarily small information entropy while quantum
systems cannot. This provides insights that allow us to understand the
analogies and differences between the two theories.

2001.07217v1,2020-01-20,2020-01-20,Close galaxy pairs with accurate photometric redshifts,"  Context. Studies of galaxy pairs can provide valuable information to jointly
understand the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups.
Consequently, taking into account the new high precision photo-z surveys, it is
important to have reliable and tested methods that allow us to properly
identify these systems and estimate their total masses and other properties.
Aims. In view of the forthcoming Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey
(PAUS) we propose and evaluate the performance of an identification algorithm
of projected close isolated galaxy pairs. We expect that the photometric
selected systems can adequately reproduce the observational properties and the
inferred lensing mass - luminosity relation of a pair of truly bound galaxies
that are hosted by the same dark matter halo. Methods. We develop an
identification algorithm that considers the projected distance between the
galaxies, the projected velocity difference and an isolation criteria in order
to restrict the sample to isolated systems. We apply our identification
algorithm using a mock galaxy catalog that mimics the features of PAUS. To
evaluate the feasibility of our pair finder, we compare the identified
photometric samples with a test sample that considers that both members are
included in the same halo. Also, taking advantage of the lensing properties
provided by the mock catalog, we apply a weak lensing analysis to determine the
mass of the selected systems. Results. Photometric selected samples tend to
show high purity values, but tend to misidentify truly bounded pairs as the
photometric redshift errors increase. Nevertheless, overall properties such as
the luminosity and mass distributions are successfully reproduced. We also
accurately reproduce the lensing mass - luminosity relation as expected for
galaxy pairs located in the same halo.

symmetry breaking develops in ultrathin samples on SiO$_2$ substrates that is

the dissociation of $^{12}$C to an $\alpha$-particle and $^8$Be in its ground

collective excitation of the Hoyle state, the 3$\alpha$ partial width of the
Hoyle state is calculable from the ratio of 3$\alpha$ decay penetrabilities of
the Hoyle and 2$^+$ states. This was calculated using the semi-classical WKB

near-by galactic disks, we confirm our previous assertion that there is an
anti-correlation between the abundance of cool neutral atomic gas and impact
parameter. Comparing the measured neutral hydrogen column densities of the
sample with the absorption strength, we find a peak in the mean spin
temperature of ~2310 K at an impact parameter of ~ 14 kpc, with > 1000 K in the
remainder of the disk. This is significantly different to the spin temperature
distribution in the Milky Way, which exhibits a constant ~ 250 - 400 K over 8 -
25 kpc. The measured column densities may, however, suffer from beam dilution,
which we show appears to be the case for the observations of HI 21-cm emission
in which the beam subtends radii of > 10 kpc. We therefore apply the column
density profile of the Milky Way, in addition to the mean of the sample,
observed at sufficiently high resolution, and the mean profile for the near-by
galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. All of the models yield a peak in the
mean spin temperature at similar radii/impact parameters (10 - 15 kpc) as the
measured column densities. These radii are similar to those of the spiral arms
where HII regions are often concentrated. We therefore suggest that the
elevated spin temperatures trace the HII regions observed in the outer disk of

2001.10858v1,2020-01-20,2020-01-20,The Case for Repeatable Analysis with Energy Economy Optimization Models,"  Energy economy optimization (EEO) models employ formal search techniques to
explore the future decision space over several decades in order to deliver
policy-relevant insights. EEO models are a critical tool for decision-makers
who must make near-term decisions with long-term effects in the face of large
future uncertainties. While the number of model-based analyses proliferates,
insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and
application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of EEO models and the
general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions
underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper
discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model
building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports,
or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes,
EEO model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world
outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a
model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that EEO models should
be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and
data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model
instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of
twelve EEO models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is
currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and
sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis.

groups in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) with a high sampling of galaxy
group members up to $z=1$. We compare our results with predictions from the

phase-space analysis of dynamics of groups with halo masses of
$M_{\mathrm{200c}}\sim 10^{12.6}-10^{14.50}M_\odot$, we show that the brightest
group galaxies (BGG) in low mass galaxy groups ($M_{\mathrm{200c}}<2 \times
10^{13} M_\odot$) have larger proper motions relative to the group velocity
dispersion than high mass groups. The dispersion in the ratio of the BGG proper
velocity to the velocity dispersion of the group,
$\sigma_{\mathrm{BGG}}/\sigma_{group}$, is on average $1.48 \pm 0.13$ for low
mass groups and $1.01 \pm 0.09$ for high mass groups. A comparative analysis of
the {\sc Horizon-AGN} simulation reveals a similar increase in the spread of
peculiar velocities of BGGs with decreasing group mass, though consistency in
the amplitude, shape, and mode of the BGG peculiar velocity distribution is
only achieved for high mass groups. The groups hosting a BGG with a large
peculiar velocity are more likely to be offset from the $L_x-\sigma_{v}$
relation; this is probably because the peculiar motion of the BGG is influenced
by the accretion of new members.

2001.07503v1,2020-01-21,2020-01-21,Rapid spectral transition of the black hole binary V404 Cyg,"  During the June 2015 outburst of the black hole binary V404 Cyg, rapid
changes in the X-ray brightness and spectra were common. The INTEGRAL
monitoring campaign detected spectacular Eddington-limited X-ray flares, but
also rapid variations at much lower flux levels. On 2015 June 21 at 20 h 50
min, the 3-10 keV JEM-X data as well as simultaneous optical data started to
display a gradual brightening from one of these low-flux states. This was
followed 15 min later by an order-of-magnitude increase of flux in the 20-40
keV IBIS/ISGRI light curve in just 15 s. The best-fitting model for both the
pre- and post-transition spectra required a Compton-thick partially covering
absorber. The absorber parameters remained constant, but the spectral slope
varied significantly during the event, with the photon index decreasing from
$\Gamma \approx 3.7$ to $\Gamma \approx 2.3$. We propose that the rapid 20-40
keV flux increase was either caused by a spectral state transition that was
hidden from our direct view, or that there was a sudden reduction in the amount
of Compton down-scattering of the primary X-ray emission in the disk outflow.

  galaxies","  This paper presents the analysis of optical integral field spectra for the HI
eXtreme (HIX) galaxy sample. HIX galaxies host at least 2.5 times more atomic
gas (HI) than expected from their optical R-band luminosity. Previous
examination of their star formation activity and HI kinematics suggested that
these galaxies stabilise their large HI discs (radii up to 94 kpc) against star
formation due to their higher than average baryonic specific angular momentum.
A comparison to semi-analytic models further showed that the elevated baryonic
specific angular momentum is inherited from the high spin of the dark matter
host. In this paper we now turn to the gas-phase metallicity as well as stellar
and ionised gas kinematics in HIX galaxies to gain insights into recent
accretion of metal-poor gas or recent mergers. We compared the stellar,
ionised, and atomic gas kinematics, and examine the variation in the gas-phase
metallicity throughout the stellar disc of HIX galaxies. We find no indication
for counter-rotation in any of the components, the central metallicities tend
to be lower than average, but as low as expected for galaxies of similar HI
mass. Metallicity gradients are comparable to other less HI-rich, local star
forming galaxies. We conclude that HIX galaxies show no conclusive evidence for
recent major accretion or merger events. Their overall lower metallicities are
likely due to being hosted by high spin halos, which slows down their evolution
and thus the enrichment of their interstellar medium.

2001.08099v1,2020-01-21,2020-01-21,PDS: Deduce Elder Privacy from Smart Homes,"  With the development of IoT technologies in the past few years, a wide range
of smart devices are deployed in a variety of environments aiming to improve
the quality of human life in a cost efficient way. Due to the increasingly
serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have
become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders'
health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live
more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders' privacy
might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network
communication. To show that elders' privacy could be substantially exposed, in
this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by
eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders' movement
activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series
of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based
on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS
in deducing and disclosing elders' privacy, which might be maliciously
exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.

  separator reconnection","  Understanding how the release of stored magnetic energy contributes to the
generation of non-thermal high energy particles during solar flares is an
important open problem in solar physics. Magnetic reconnection plays a
fundamental role in the energy release and conversion processes taking place
during flares. A common approach for investigating particle acceleration is to
use test particles in fields derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of reconnection. These MHD simulations use anomalous resistivities that are
much larger than the Spitzer resistivity based on Coulomb collisions. The
processes leading to enhanced resistivity should also affect the test
particles. We explore the link between resistivity and particle orbits building
on a previous study using a 2D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection. This
paper extends the previous investigation to a 3D magnetic reconnection
configuration and to study the effect on test particle orbits. We carried out
orbit calculations using a 3D MHD simulation of separator reconnection. We use
the relativistic guiding centre approximation including stochastic pitch angle
scattering. The effects of varying the resistivity and the models for pitch
angle scattering on particle orbit trajectories, final positions, energy
spectra, final pitch angle distribution, and orbit duration are all studied in
detail. Pitch angle scattering widens collimated beams of orbit trajectories,
allowing orbits to access previously unaccessible field lines; this causes
final positions to spread to topological structures that were previously
inaccessible. Scattered orbit energy spectra are found to be predominantly
affected by the level of anomalous resistivity, with the pitch angle scattering
model only playing a role in isolated cases. Scattering is found to play a
crucial role in determining the pitch angle and orbit duration distributions.

photometry of globular clusters' stars. We quantify their respective effects on
the position of stars in the chromosome map, especially among the first
population. We computed atmosphere models and synthetic spectra for stars of
different chemical compositions, based on isochrones produced by stellar
evolution calculations with abundance variations representative of first and
second populations in GCs. From this we built synthetic chromosome maps for a
mixture of stars of different chemical compositions. We subsequently replaced a
fraction of stars with binaries, or stars with chromospheric emission, using
synthetic spectroscopy. We studied how the position of stars is affected in the
chromosome map. Binaries can, in principle, explain the extension of the first
population in the chromosome map. However, we find that given the binary
fraction reported for GCs, the density of stars in the extended part is too
small. Another difficulty of the binary explanation is that the shape of the
distribution of the first population in the chromosome map is different in
clusters with similar binary fractions. Additionally, we find that the
contribution of chromospheric emission lines to the HST photometry is too small
to have an observable impact on the shape of the chromosome map. Continuum
chromospheric emission has an effect qualitatively similar to binaries. We
conclude that binaries do have an impact on the morphology of the chromosome
map of GCs, but they are unlikely to explain entirely the shape of the extended
distribution of the first population stars. Uncertainties in the properties of
continuum chromospheric emission of stars in GCs prevent any quantitative
conclusion. Therefore, the origin of the extended first population remains
unexplained.

especially because LBS providers can be honest-but-curious, collecting queries

both centralized and decentralized location privacy protection schemes for

overcome disadvantages of centralized schemes, eliminating anonymizers, and
enhancing users' control over sensitive information. However, an insecure
decentralized system could create serious risks beyond private information
leakage. More so, attacking an improperly designed decentralized LBS privacy
protection scheme could be an effective and low-cost step to breach user

  galaxies","  The aim of this paper is to investigate the claim that stars in the lensing
galaxy of a gravitationally lensed quasar system can always account for the
observed microlensing of the individual quasar images. A small sample of
gravitationally lensed quasar systems was chosen where the quasar images appear
to lie on the fringe of the stellar distribution of the lensing galaxy. As with
most quasar systems, all the individual quasar images were observed to be
microlensed. The surface brightness of the lensing galaxy at the positions of
the quasar images was measured from HST frames, and converted to stellar
surface mass density. The surface density of smoothly distributed dark matter
at the image positions was obtained from lensing models of the quasar systems
and applied to the stellar surface mass density to give the optical depth to
microlensing. This was then used to assess the probability that the stars in
the lensing galaxy could be responsible for the observed microlensing. The
results were supported by microlensing simulations of the star fields around
the quasar images combined with values of convergence and shear from the
lensing models. Taken together, the probability that all the observed
microlensing is due to stars was found to be ~0.0003. Errors resulting from
surface brightness measurement, mass-to-light ratio and the contribution of the
dark matter halo do not significantly affect this result. It is argued that the
most plausible candidates for the microlenses are primordial black holes,
either in the dark matter halos of the lensing galaxies, or more generally
distributed along the lines of sight to the quasars.

propagation in nematic liquid crystals is undertaken. These dispersive shock
waves are generated from step initial conditions for the optical field and are
resonant in that linear diffractive waves are in resonance with the DSW,
resulting in a resonant linear wavetrain propagating ahead of it. It is found
that there are six regimes, which are distinct and require different solution
methods. In previous studies, the same solution method was used for all
regimes, which does not yield solutions in full agreement with numerical
solutions. Indeed, the standard DSW structure disappears for sufficiently large
initial jumps. Asymptotic theory, approximate methods or Whitham modulation
theory are used to find solutions for these resonant dispersive shock waves in
a given regime. The solutions are found to be in excellent agreement with
numerical solutions of the nematic equations in all regimes. It is found that
for small initial jumps, the resonant wavetrain is unstable, but that it
stabilises above a critical jump height. It is additionally found that the DSW
is unstable, except for small jump heights for which there is no resonance and
large jump heights for which there is no standard DSW structure.

the X-ray band offers an unprecendented opportunity to gain insight into
physical processes in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields. Up to now,
most of our knowledge about magnetar sources came from spectral analysis, which
allowed to test the resonant Compton scattering scenario and to probe the
structure of the star magnetosphere. On the other hand, radiation emitted from
magnetar surface is expected to be strongly polarized and its observed
polarization pattern bears the imprint of both scatterings onto magnetospheric
charges and QED effects as it propagates in the magnetized vacuum around the
star. X-ray polarimeters scheduled to fly in the next years will finally allow
to exploit the wealth of information stored in the polarization observables.
Here we revisit the problem of assessing the spectro-polarimetric properties of
magnetar persistent emission. At variance with previous investigations, proper
account for more physical surface emission models is made by considering either
a condensed surface or a magnetized atmosphere. Results are used to simulate
polarimetric observations with the forthcoming Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE). We find that X-ray polarimetry will allow to detect QED vacuum

barrier to treatment success. While research has traditionally focused on
genetic sources of resistance, recent findings suggest that cancer cells can
acquire transient resistant phenotypes via epigenetic modifications and other
non-genetic mechanisms. Although these resistant phenotypes are eventually
relinquished by individual cells, they can temporarily 'save' the tumor from
extinction and enable the emergence of more permanent resistance mechanisms.
These observations have generated interest in the potential of epigenetic
therapies for long-term tumor control or eradication. In this work, we develop
a mathematical model to study how phenotypic switching at the single-cell level
affects resistance evolution in cancer. We highlight unique features of
non-genetic resistance, probe the evolutionary consequences of epigenetic drugs
and explore potential therapeutic strategies. We find that even short-term
epigenetic modifications and stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can
drive long-term drug resistance in the absence of any bona fide resistance
mechanisms. We also find that an epigenetic drug that slightly perturbs the
average retention of the resistant phenotype can turn guaranteed treatment
failure into guaranteed success. Lastly, we find that combining an epigenetic
drug with an anti-cancer agent can significantly outperform monotherapy, and
that treatment outcome is heavily affected by drug sequencing.

clusters, to calibrate the Ca II triplet (CaT) metallicity relation and derive
metallicities for all individual stars. We investigate the overall metallicity
distributions as well as those of the different populations within each
cluster.
  Methods. The Ca II triplet in the near-infrared at 8498, 8542, and 8662 AA is
visible in stars with spectral types between F and M and can be used to
determine their metallicities. In this work, we calibrate the relation using
average cluster metallicities from literature and MUSE spectra, and extend it
below the horizontal branch - a cutoff that has traditionally been made to
avoid a non-linear relation - using a quadratic function. In addition to the
classic relation based on V-VHB we also present calibrations based on absolute
magnitude and luminosity. The obtained relations are then used to calculate
metallicities for all the stars in the sample and to derive metallicity
distributions for different populations within a cluster, which have been
separated using so-called ""chromosome maps"" based on HST photometry.
  Results. We show that, despite the relatively low spectral resolution of MUSE
(R=1900-3700) we can derive single star metallicities with a mean statistical
intra-cluster uncertainty of ~0.12 dex. We present metallicity distributions
for the RGB stars in 25 GCs, and investigate the different metallicities of the
populations P3 (and higher) in so-called metal-complex or Type II clusters,
finding metallicity variations in all of them. We also detected unexpected

  double quantum dots","  Recently, novel Coulomb drag mechanisms in capacitively coupled double
quantum dots were uncovered by the T-matrix based master equation (TME). The
TME is so far the primary approach to studying Coulomb drag in the
weak-coupling regime; however, its accuracy and reliability remain unexplored.
Here, we evaluate the performance of the TME for Coulomb drag via a comparison
with numerically exact results obtained by the hierarchical equation-of-motion
approach. We find that the TME can capture qualitative current evolutions
versus dot levels, temperature, and effective coupling strengths, but only
partially succeeds at the quantitative level. Specifically, the TME gives
highly inaccurate drag currents when large charge fluctuations on dots exist
and the fourth-order tunneling processes make a leading-order contribution.
This failure of the TME is attributed to the combined effect of the unique drag
mechanisms and its overlook of the fourth-order single-electron tunnelings. We
identify the reliable regions to facilitate further quantitative studies on
Coulomb drag by the TME.

sections are well reproduced with spectroscopic amplitudes from two different
shell model interactions for the Si isotopes: \textit{psdmod} for the
two-neutron transfer, and \textit{psdmwkpn} for the one-neutron transfer.
  Purpose: The origin of this ambiguity can be related to a more complex
mechanism in the one-neutron transfer that requires the unpairing of neutrons
prior to its transfer in the ($^{18}$O,$^{17}$O) reaction. Studying a nucleus
where this characteristic is absent ($^{13}$C) should help to elucidate this

LIGO/Virgo detectors. If interpreted as a double neutron star merger, the total
gravitational mass is substantially larger than that of the binary systems
identified in the Galaxy. In this work we analyze the gravitational-wave data
within the neutron star$-$black hole merger scenario. For the black hole, we
yield a mass of $2.40^{+0.36}_{-0.32}M_\odot$ and an aligned spin of
$0.141^{+0.067}_{-0.064}$. As for the neutron star we find a mass of
$1.15^{+0.15}_{-0.13}M_\odot$ and the dimensionless tidal deformability of
$1.4^{+3.8}_{-1.2}\times 10^{3}$. These parameter ranges are for 90\%
credibility. The inferred masses of the neutron star and the black hole are not
in tension with current observations and we suggest that GW190425 is a viable
candidate of a neutron star$-$black hole merger event. Benefitting from the
continual enhancement of the sensitivities of the advanced gravitational
detectors and the increase of the number of the observatories, similar events
are anticipated to be much more precisely measured in the future and the
presence of black holes below the so-called mass gap will be unambiguously
clarified. If confirmed, the mergers of neutron stars with (quickly rotating)
low-mass black holes are likely important production sites of the heaviest
r-process elements.

  Highly Mobile Millimeter Wave Communication","  Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a growing area of communication
with a variety of use cases. This paper investigates the problem of
vehicle-cell association in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication networks.
The aim is to maximize the time average rate per vehicular user (VUE) while
ensuring a target minimum rate for all VUEs with low signaling overhead. We
first formulate the user (vehicle) association problem as a discrete non-convex
optimization problem. Then, by leveraging tools from machine learning,
specifically distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) and the
asynchronous actor critic algorithm (A3C), we propose a low complexity
algorithm that approximates the solution of the proposed optimization problem.
The proposed DDRL-based algorithm endows every road side unit (RSU) with a
local RL agent that selects a local action based on the observed input state.
Actions of different RSUs are forwarded to a central entity, that computes a
global reward which is then fed back to RSUs. It is shown that each
independently trained RL performs the vehicle-RSU association action with low
control overhead and less computational complexity compared to running an
online complex algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Finally,
simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves up to 15\% gains in

static case this dynamics of encoding manifests itself in kinematic space,
which is a copy of de Sitter space ${\rm dS}_2$, in a particularly instructive

of entanglement, associated with conditional mutual informations of overlapping
regions, are related to triangulations of geodesic $N$-gons. Such
triangulations are then mapped to causal patterns in kinematic space. For a
fixed $N$ the space of all causal patterns is related to the associahedron
${\mathcal K}^{N-3}$ an object well-known from previous studies on scattering
amplitudes. On this space of causal patterns cluster dynamics acts by a
recursion provided by a Zamolodchikov's $Y$-system of type $(A_{N-3},A_1)$. We
observe that the space of causal patterns is equipped with a partial order, and

It is proposed that eutectic lines exist between certain eutectic alloys in

Furthermore, by investigating the compositions of verified eutectic alloys in

relations between the concentrations of constituent elements in eutectic

radiation intensity on a given harmonic can be essentially larger than that for
the same charge rotating in the vacuum or in a homogeneous transparent medium

  stellar variability","  New photometric space missions to detect and characterise transiting
exoplanets are focusing on bright stars to obtain high cadence, high
signal-to-noise light curves. Since these missions will be sensitive to stellar
oscillations and granulation even for dwarf stars, they will be limited by
stellar variability. We tested the performance of Gaussian process (GP)
regression on the characterisation of transiting planets, and in particular to
determine how many components of variability are necessary to describe high
cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. We
found that the best GP stellar variability model contains four to five
variability components: one stellar oscillation component, two to four
granulation components, and/or one rotational modulation component. This high
number of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model (1GP)
commonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore, we
compared the performance of the best multi-component GP model with the 1GP
model in the derivation of transit parameters of simulated transits. We found
that for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best multi-component GP model is
slightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP model that
gives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails to retrieve
the transit because it is a poor description of stellar activity. The non-GP
model gives some biased results and the best multi-component GP is capable of
retrieving the correct transit model parameters. We conclude that when
characterising transiting exoplanets with high signal-to-noise ratios and high
cadence light curves, we need models that couple the description of stellar
variability with the transits analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for Earth-like
exoplanets a better description of stellar variability improves the planetary
characterisation.

more effective in terms of reducing traffic from the network and also shifting
car drivers/passengers to other modes of travel. The enhancement of bus
infrastructure in relation to increase in frequency caused shifting of

build a series of equations of state for hypernuclear compact stars, by
calibrating the coupling constants of the $\Xi$-hyperon to the experimental
binding energy of the single-$\Xi$ hypernuclei $^{15}_{\Xi^-}$C and
$^{12}_{\Xi^-}$Be. Coupling constants of the $\Lambda$-hyperon to nucleons have
been calibrated on a vast collection of experimental data on single
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei and we employ those values. Uncertainties on the
couplings of the $\Sigma$-hyperon to nuclear matter, due to lack of
experimental data, are accounted for by allowing for a wide variation of the
well depth of $\Sigma$ at rest in symmetric saturated nuclear matter. To
account for uncertainties in the nucleonic sector at densities much larger than
the saturation density, a rich collection of parametrizations is employed, some
of them in agreement with existing constraints from nuclear physics and
astrophysics. Neutron star properties are investigated with all these
calibrated equations of state. The effects of the presence of hyperons on the
radius, on the tidal deformability, on the moment of inertia, and on the
nucleonic direct Urca process are discussed. The sensitivity of the hyperonic
direct Urca processes to uncertainties in the nucleonic and hyperonic sectors
is also addressed. It is shown that the relative variations of the radius,
tidal deformability and moment of inertia from the values that characterize
purely nucleonic stars are linearly correlated with the strangeness fraction.
The maximum radius deviation, obtained for most massive neutron stars, is
$\approx 10\%$. The reduction of the maximum mass, triggered by nucleation of
strangeness, is estimated at $\approx 15 - 20\%$, out of which 5\% comes from
insufficient information on the $\Sigma$-hyperon interactions.

  period bimodality and simultaneous variability decrease","  Rotation period measurements of stars observed with the Kepler mission have
revealed a lack of stars at intermediate rotation periods, accompanied by a
decrease of photometric variability. Whether this so-called dearth region is a
peculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general manifestation
of stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. Our goal is to measure
stellar rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of
K2 stars, located in different fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light
on the relation between stellar rotation and photometric variability. We use
Lomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine
consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by
computing the variability range from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian
mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution.
Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in
29,860 stars. For effective temperatures below 6000K, the variability range
shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of
750 Myr. Additionally, the K2 rotation period distribution shows evidence for
bimodality, although the dearth region is less pronounced compared to the
Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good
agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. We conclude that
the period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a
general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in
the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright
faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been
underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness
variability on the rotation period.

Motivated by the observation that the average degree growth of nodes is

relevant class of network models where preferential attachment is combined with
heterogeneous node fitness and aging. We propose a novel analytical framework
based on the time-invariance of the studied systems and show that it is
self-consistent only for two special network growth forms: the uniform and
exponential network growth. Conversely, the breaking of such time-invariance
explains the winner-takes-all effect in some model settings, revealing the
connection between the Bose-Einstein condensation in the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si
model and similar gelation in superlinear preferential attachment. Aging is
necessary to reproduce realistic node degree growth curves and can prevent the
winner-takes-all effect under weak conditions. Our results are verified by
extensive numerical simulations.

2001.08137v2,2020-01-22,2020-01-22,Pseudoinvariance and the extra degree of freedom in f(T) gravity,"  Nonlinear generalizations of teleparallel gravity entail the modification of
a Lagrangian that is pseudoinvariant under local Lorentz transformations of the
tetrad field. This procedure consequently leads to the loss of the local
pseudoinvariance and the appearance of additional degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).
The constraint structure of f(T) gravity suggests the existence of one extra
d.o.f. when compared with GR, which should describe some aspect of the
orientation of the tetrad. The purpose of this article is to better understand
the nature of this extra d.o.f. by means of a toy model that mimics essential
features of f(T) gravity. We find that the nonlinear modification of a
Lagrangian L possessing a local rotational pseudoinvariance produces two types
of solutions. In one case the original gauge-invariant variables -- the
analogue of the metric in teleparallelism -- evolve like when governed by the
(nondeformed) Lagrangian L; these solutions are characterized by a (selectable)
constant value of its Lagrangian, which is the manifestation of the extra
d.o.f. In the other case, the solutions do contain new dynamics for the
original gauge-invariant variables, but the extra d.o.f. does not materialize
because the Lagrangian remains invariant on-shell. Coming back to f(T) gravity,
the first case includes solutions where the torsion scalar T is a constant, to
be chosen at the initial conditions (extra d.o.f.), and no new dynamics for the
metric is expected. The latter case covers those solutions displaying a genuine
modified gravity; T is not a constant, but it is (on-shell) invariant under
Lorentz transformations depending only on time. Both kinds of f(T) solutions
are exemplified in a flat FLRW universe. Finally, we present a toy model for a
higher-order Lagrangian with rotational invariance [analogous to f(R) gravity]
and derive its constraint structure and number of d.o.f.

magnetic fields, $B\sim 10^{15}\,{\rm G}$, in a neutron star (NS) accounting
for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) driven by the shock in a supernova (SN)
progenitor of that NS. The temperature jump at a narrow shock front, where an
initial magnetic field existing in inflowing matter rises sharply, is the
source of the CME that prevails significantly the erasure of the CME due to the
spin-flip through Coulomb collisions in plasma. The growth of the magnetic
field just behind the shock given by the instability term $\nabla\times (\alpha

throws out the mantle of a protoneutron star. As a result, such an explosion
interrupts the transfer of strongly magnetized plasma from the shock onto NS
surface and leads to the saturation of the magnetic field. Assuming the rigid
protostar rotation, we employ the mean field dynamo, which is similar to the
$\alpha^2$-dynamo known in the standard magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The novelty
of our model is that $\alpha^2$-dynamo is based on concepts of particle
physics, applied in MHD, rather than by a mirror asymmetry of convective
vortices in the rotating convection.

2001.08161v2,2020-01-22,2020-01-22,Cloaking the Underlying Long-Range Order of Randomly Perturbed Lattices,"  Random, uncorrelated displacements of particles on a lattice preserve the
hyperuniformity of the original lattice, that is, normalized density
fluctuations vanish in the limit of infinite wavelengths. In addition to a
diffuse contribution, the scattering intensity from the the resulting point
pattern typically inherits the Bragg peaks (long-range order) of the original
lattice. Here we demonstrate how these Bragg peaks can be hidden in the
effective diffraction pattern of independent and identically distributed
perturbations. All Bragg peaks vanish if and only if the sum of all probability
densities of the positions of the shifted lattice points is a constant at all
positions. The underlying long-range order is then 'cloaked' in the sense that
it cannot be reconstructed from the pair correlation function alone. On the one
hand, density fluctuations increase monotonically with the strength of
perturbations $a$, as measured by the hyperuniformity order metric
$\overline{\Lambda}$. On the other hand, the disappearance and reemergence of
long-range order, depending on whether the system is cloaked or not as the
perturbation strength increases, is manifestly captured by the $\tau$ order
metric. Therefore, while the perturbation strength $a$ may seem to be a natural
choice for an order metric of perturbed lattices, the $\tau$ order metric is a
superior choice. It is noteworthy that cloaked perturbed lattices allow one to
easily simulate very large samples (with at least $10^6$ particles) of
disordered hyperuniform point patterns without Bragg peaks.

than the Red Clump (RC) is found to be significantly flatter than the
distribution of the faint stars. We investigate the 3D structure of the central
stellar cusp using our results on the MWNSC structure on large scales to
constrain the deprojection of the measured stellar surface number density,
obtaining a value of the 3D inner power law of
$\gamma=1.38\pm0.06_{sys}\pm0.01_{stat}$. Conclusions. The MWNSC shares its
main properties with other extragalactic NSCs found in spiral galaxies. The
differences in the structure between bright giants and RC stars might be
related to the existence of not completely mixed populations of different ages.
This may hint at recent growth of the MWNSC through star formation or cluster
accretion.

  High-contrast imaging with VLT/SPHERE","  We study the multiplicity of host stars to known transiting extra-solar
planets to test competing theories on the formation mechanisms of hot Jupiters.
We observed 45 exoplanet host stars using VLT/SPHERE/IRDIS to search for
potential companions. For each identified candidate companion we determined the
probability that it is gravitationally bound to its host by performing common
proper motion checks and modelling of synthetic stellar populations around the
host. We detected new candidate companions around K2-38, WASP-72, WASP-80,
WASP-87, WASP-88, WASP-108, WASP-118, WASP-120, WASP-122, WASP123, WASP-130,
WASP-131 and WASP-137. The closest candidates were detected at separations of
$0.124''\pm0.007''$ and $0.189''\pm0.003''$ around WASP-108 and WASP-131; the
measured $K$ band contrasts indicate that these are stellar companions of
$0.35\pm0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and $0.62^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively.
Including the re-detection and confirmation of previously known companions in
13 other systems we derived a multiplicity fraction of
$55.4^{+5.9}_{-9.4}\,\%$. For the representative sub-sample of 40 hot Jupiter
host stars among our targets, the derived multiplicity rate is
$54.8^{+6.3}_{-9.9}\,\%$. Our data do not confirm any trend that systems with
eccentric planetary companions are preferably part of multiple systems. On
average, we reached a magnitude contrast of $8.5\pm0.9$ mag at an angular
separation of 0.5''. This allows to exclude additional stellar companions with
masses larger than $0.08$ M$_\odot$ for almost all observed systems; around the
closest and youngest systems this sensitivity is achieved at physical
separations as small as 10 au. The presented study shows that SPHERE is an
ideal instrument to detect and characterize close companions to exoplanetary
host stars.

  properties of transiting planetary systems with companions","  We perform a detailed study of six transiting planetary systems with
relatively bright stars close enough to affect observations of these systems.
Light curves are analysed taking into account the contaminating light and its
uncertainty. We present and apply a method to correct the velocity amplitudes
of the host stars for the presence of contaminating light. We determine the
physical properties of six systems (WASP-20, WASP-70, WASP-8, WASP-76, WASP-2
and WASP-131) accounting for contaminating light. In the case of WASP-20 the
measured physical properties are very different for the three scenarios
considered (ignoring binarity, planet transits brighter star, and planet
transits fainter star). In the other five cases our results are very similar to
those obtained neglecting contaminating light. We use our results to determine
the mean correction factors to planet radius, $\langle X_R\rangle$, mass,
$\langle X_M\rangle$, and density, $\langle X_\rho\rangle$, caused by nearby
objects. We find $\langle X_R\rangle=1.009\pm0.045$, which is smaller than
literature values because we were able to reject the possibility that the
planet orbits the fainter star in all but one case. We find $\langle
X_M\rangle=1.031\pm0.019$, which is larger than $\langle X_R\rangle$ because of
the strength of the effect of contaminating light on the radial velocity
measurements of the host star. We find $\langle X_\rho\rangle=0.995\pm 0.046$:
the small size of this correction is due to two effects: the corrections on
planet radius and mass partially cancel; and some nearby stars are close enough
to contaminate the light curves of the system but not radial velocities of the
host star. We conclude that binarity of planet host stars is important for the
small number of transiting hot Jupiters with a very bright and close nearby
star, but it has only a small effect on population-level studies of these
objects.

vehicle development. However, unique driving styles, inconsistent behavior, and
complex decision processes render it a challenging task, and existing
approaches often lack variability or robustness. To approach this problem, we
propose Probabilistic Modeling of Driver behavior (ProMoD), a modular framework
which splits the task of driver behavior modeling into multiple modules. A
global target trajectory distribution is learned with Probabilistic Movement
Primitives, clothoids are utilized for local path generation, and the
corresponding choice of actions is performed by a neural network. Experiments
in a simulated car racing setting show considerable advantages in imitation
accuracy and robustness compared to other imitation learning algorithms. The
modular architecture of the proposed framework facilitates straightforward
extensibility in driving line adaptation and sequencing of multiple movement
primitives for future research.

fitting code for extragalactic studies. However, the current version of CIGALE
is not able to fit X-ray data, which often provide unique insights into AGN
intrinsic power. We develop a new X-ray module for CIGALE, allowing it to fit
SEDs from the X-ray to infrared (IR). We also improve the AGN fitting of CIGALE
from UV-to-IR wavelengths. We implement a modern clumpy two-phase torus model,
SKIRTOR. To account for moderately extincted type 1 AGNs, we implement
polar-dust extinction. We publicly release the source code (named X-CIGALE). We
test X-CIGALE with X-ray detected AGNs in SDSS, COSMOS, and AKARI-NEP. The
fitting quality (as indicated by reduced $\chi^2$) is good in general,
indicating that X-CIGALE is capable of modelling the observed SED from X-ray to
IR. We discuss constrainability and degeneracy of model parameters in the
fitting of AKARI-NEP, for which excellent mid-IR photometric coverage is
available. We also test fitting a sample of AKARI-NEP galaxies for which only
X-ray upper limits are available from Chandra observations, and find that the
upper limit can effectively constrain the AGN SED contribution for some
systems. Finally, using X-CIGALE, we assess the ability of Athena to constrain
the AGN activity in future extragalactic studies.

main and early shocks in 1485 RR~Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge observed by
the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We selected non-modulated
fundamental-mode RR~Lyrae stars with good-quality photometry. Using a
self-developed method, we determined the centers and strengths of main and
early shock features in the phased light curves. We found that the position of
both humps and bumps are highly correlated with the pulsation properties of the
studied variables. Pulsators with a pronounced main shock are concentrated in
the low-amplitude regime of the period-amplitude diagram, while stars with a
strong early shock have average and above-average pulsation amplitudes. A
connection between the main and early shocks and the Fourier coefficients is
also observed. In the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we see a separation
between stars with strong and weak shocks. Variables with a pronounced main
shock cluster close to the fundamental red edge of the instability strip (IS),
while stars with a strong early shock tend to clump in the center and near the
fundamental blue edge of the IS. The appearance of shocks and their properties
seem independent of the direction of evolution estimated from the period change
rate of the studied stars. In addition, the differences in the period change
rate between the two main Oosterhoff groups found in the Galactic bulge suggest
that stars of Oosterhoff type I are located close to the zero-age horizontal
branch while Oosterhoff type II variables are on their way toward the
fundamental red edge of the instability strip, thus having already left the
zero-age horizontal branch.

Purpose: Accurate new measurements of low-energy deuteron-induced reaction
cross sections for monoisotopic (55Mn) natural manganese target enhance the
related database as well as the opportunity of an unitary and consistent
account of the related reaction mechanisms. Method: Activation cross sections

on 55Mn up to 50 MeV are analyzed paying particular attention to BU and direct
reaction (DR) mechanisms. Results: Newly measured activation cross sections
strengthen the deuteron database at low energies, at once with a consistent
account for the first time of all available data. Conclusions: Due account of

data at low energies, is provided by a suitable BU and DR assessment.

We find that the occurrence of the stick-slip or anchored regimes is controlled
by the roughness factor, defined as the ratio between the size of the surface

atoms in triplet Rydberg states with principal quantum number $n=38$ has been
controlled using electric fields below 15 V/cm in intrabeam collisions at
translational temperatures of $\sim1$ K. The experiments were performed in
pulsed supersonic beams of NH$_3$ seeded in He at a ratio of 1:19. The He atoms
were prepared in the metastable 1s2s $^3$S$_1$ level in a pulsed electric
discharge in the trailing part of the beams. The velocity slip between the
heavy NH$_3$ and the lighter metastable He was exploited to perform collision
studies at center-of-mass collision speeds of $\sim70$ m/s. Resonant energy
transfer in the atom-molecule collisions was identified by
Rydberg-state-selective electric-field ionization. The experimental data have
been compared to a theoretical model of the resonant dipole-dipole interactions
between the collision partners based on the impact parameter method.

2002.07037v1,2020-01-23,2020-01-23,Dark Energy Gravitational Wave Observations and Ice Age Periodicity,"  Dark Energy is the dominant component of the energy density of the Universe.
However, it is also very elusive since its interaction with the rest of the
Universe is primarily gravitational.Since Dark Energy is a low energy
phenomenon from the perspective of particle physics and field theory, a
fundamental approach based on fields in curved space is sufficient to
understand the current dynamics of Dark Energy. The key issue is to understand
the gravitational dynamics of Dark Energy and its observational consequences.
However, finding the observational consequences of Dark Energy dynamics has
been a very challenging task. For something which is the dominant component of
the energy density of the Universe, Dark Energy appears to be very distant and
reclusive. Here we show that the Dark Energy dynamics results in the production
of gravitational waves which produce the ellipticity variation in the orbit of
earth that results in the periodicity of the Ice Ages observed and documented
by geologists and climatologists. Previously, no observational signature of
gravitational waves produced by Dark Energy dynamics has been reported.
Further, no interpretation of the ellipticity variation of the orbit of earth
due to gravitational waves or the linking of such gravitational waves to the
Ice Age periodicity has been reported previously. We hope that the current work
will lead to some fresh insights and some more interesting work.

  regions during a coronal mass ejection","  Context. Some of the most prominent sources for particle acceleration in our
Solar System are large eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These accelerated particles can generate radio
emission through various mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by a
variety of solar radio bursts with different shapes and characteristics in
dynamic spectra. Radio bursts directly associated with CMEs often show movement
in the direction of CME expansion. Here, we aim to determine the emission
mechanism of multiple moving radio bursts that accompanied a flare and CME that
took place on 14 June 2012. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nancay
Radioheliograph, combined with observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, to analyse these moving
radio bursts in order to determine their emission mechanism and
three-dimensional (3D) location with respect to the expanding CME. Results. In
using a 3D representation of the particle acceleration locations in relation to
the overlying coronal magnetic field and the CME propagation, for the first
time, we provide evidence that these moving radio bursts originate near the CME
flanks and some that are possible signatures of shock-accelerated electrons
following the fast CME expansion in the low corona. Conclusions. The moving
radio bursts, as well as other stationary bursts observed during the eruption,
occur simultaneously with a type IV continuum in dynamic spectra, which is not
usually associated with emission at the CME flanks. Our results show that
moving radio bursts that could traditionally be classified as moving type IVs
can represent shock signatures associated with CME flanks or plasma emission
inside the CME behind its flanks, which are closely related to the lateral
expansion of the CME in the low corona.

composition, and target stoichiometry during data taking is critical to account
for possible target modifications and to reduce uncertainties in the final
cross-section results. A common technique used for these purposes is the
Nuclear Resonant Reaction Analysis (NRRA), which however requires that a narrow

cases when this is not possible, as for example the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction
recently studied at low energies at the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear
Astrophysics (LUNA) in Italy, alternative approaches must be found. Here, we

even in non-magnetic materials. Although this effect is illustrated by
considering a single layer of the WSe2 dichalogenide, the phenomenon is
completely general and valid for any non-magnetic material with spin-orbit

additional effective flipping mechanism for the electron spin and its
implications in the transport and scattering properties of the material are
evident and profound.

Furthermore, we have observed well-defined quantized Hall plateaus together
with vanishing interlayer conductivity at low temperatures as a hallmark of the
half-integer QHE in a bulk form. The Hall conductance of each layer is found to
be nearly quantized to $2(N+1/2)e^2/h$ with $N$ being the Landau index, which
is consistent with two spin-polarized Dirac valleys protected by the strong
spin-valley coupling.

Based on the [HCO+ (2 - 1)]/[HOC+ (2 - 1)] ratio, we obtain a high ionization
degree in the CND of NGC 1068. It is found that HC3N is concentrated in the
east knot, while 13CCH, CH3CN, SO, HOC+, CS, CH3CCH, and H2CO are concentrated
in the west knot. Compared to the star-forming galaxies M 82 and NGC 253, the
chemistry of NGC 1068 might be less strongly affected by the UV radiation

2001.08748v1,2020-01-23,2020-01-23,A Galactic-scale gas wave in the Solar Neighborhood,"  For the past 150 years, the prevailing view of the local Interstellar Medium
(ISM) was based on a peculiarity known as the Gould's Belt, an expanding ring
of young stars, gas, and dust, tilted about 20$^\circ$ to the Galactic plane.
Still, the physical relation between local gas clouds has remained practically
unknown because the distance accuracy to clouds is of the same order or larger
than their sizes. With the advent of large photometric surveys and the Gaia
satellite astrometric survey this situation has changed. Here we report the 3-D
structure of all local cloud complexes. We find a narrow and coherent 2.7 kpc
arrangement of dense gas in the Solar neighborhood that contains many of the
clouds thought to be associated with the Gould Belt. This finding is
inconsistent with the notion that these clouds are part of a ring, disputing
the Gould Belt model. The new structure comprises the majority of nearby
star-forming regions, has an aspect ratio of about 1:20, and contains about 3
million solar masses of gas. Remarkably, the new structure appears to be
undulating and its 3-D distribution is well described by a damped sinusoidal
wave on the plane of the Milky Way, with an average period of about 2 kpc and a
maximum amplitude of about 160 pc. Our results represent a first step in the
revision of the local gas distribution and Galactic structure and offer a new,
broader context to studies on the transformation of molecular gas into stars.

absence of propagation effects, this ""photon ring"" has universal features that
are completely governed by general relativity and independent of the details of
the emission. Here, we show that the polarimetric image of a black hole also
displays universal properties. In particular, the photon ring exhibits a
self-similar pattern of polarization that encodes the black hole spin. We
explore the corresponding universal polarimetric signatures of the photon ring
on long interferometric baselines, and propose a method for measuring the black
hole spin using a sparse interferometric array. These signatures could enable
spin measurements of the supermassive black hole in M87, as well as precision
tests of general relativity in the strong field regime, via a future extension
of the Event Horizon Telescope to space.

  emitters not belonging to extreme Population A","  The quasar class of extreme Population A (xA) (also known as super-Eddington
accreting massive black holes, SEAMBHs) has been hailed as potential distance
indicators for cosmology. The aim of this paper is to define tight criteria for
their proper identification starting from the main selection criterion
$R_{FeII} > 1 $, and to identify potential intruders not meeting the selection
criteria, but nonetheless selected as xA because of the coarseness of automatic
searches. Inclusion of the spurious xA sources may dramatically increase the
dispersion in the Hubble diagram of quasars obtained from virial luminosity
estimates. We studied a sample of 32 low-$z$ quasars originally selected from
the SDSS DR7 as xA. All of them show moderate-to-strong FeII emission and the
wide majority strong absorption features in their spectra are typical of fairly
evolved stellar populations. We performed a simultaneous fit of a host galaxy
spectrum, AGN continuum, FeII template and emission lines to spectra, using the
fitting technique based on ULySS, full spectrum fitting package. For sources in
our sample (of spectral types corresponding to relatively low Eddington ratio),
we found an overall consistency between narrow components of H$\beta$ and
[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 line shifts and the mean stellar velocity
obtained from the host galaxy fit (within $\lesssim |60|$ km/s). Only one
source in our sample qualify as xA source. We found high fraction of host
galaxy spectrum (in half of the sample even higher then 40\%). When absorption
lines are prominent, and the fraction of the host galaxy is high, SSP is
mimicking FeII, and that may result in a mistaken identification of FeII
spectral features. We have identified several stellar absorption lines that,
along with the continuum shape, may lead to an overestimate of $R_{FeII}$, and
therefore to the misclassification of sources as xA sources.

more accurate results than the conventional FEM. Currently, much commercial
software and many open-source packages have been developed to analyze various

The Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language
that was originally designed for high-performance computing. We term our

tests are conducted. The benchmark results show that (1) juSFEM can achieve
accurate results when compared to commercial FEM software ABAQUS, and (2)
juSFEM only requires 543 seconds to calculate the displacements of a 3D elastic
cantilever beam model which is composed of approximately 2 million tetrahedral
elements, while in contrast the commercial FEM software needs 930 seconds for

implications for understanding their formation mechanism. Many nearby late-M
dwarfs that have previously been identified in the field are in fact young
brown dwarf members of nearby young associations. Some of them are still
accreting. They are therefore excellent targets for further studies of the
accretion process in the very low-mass regime at different stages.
  We aim to search for accreting young brown dwarf candidates in a sample of 85
nearby late-M dwarfs.
  Using photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE, we constructed the
spectral energy distribution of the late-M dwarfs based on BT-Settl models to
detect infrared excesses. We then searched for lithium and H$\alpha$ emission
in candidates that exhibit infrared excesses to confirm their youth and the
presence of accretion.
  Among the 85 late-M dwarfs, only DENIS-P J1538317$-$103850 (M5.5) shows
strong infrared excesses in WISE bands. The detection of lithium absorption in
the M5.5 dwarf and its Gaia trigonometric parallax indicate an age of $\sim$1
Myr and a mass of 47 $M_{\rm J}$. The H$\alpha$ emission line in the brown
dwarf shows significant variability that indicates sporadic accretion. This 1
Myr-old brown dwarf also exhibits intense accretion bursts with accretion rates
of up to $10^{-7.9}$$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.
  Our detection of sporadic accretion in one of the youngest brown dwarfs might
imply that sporadic accretion at early stages could play an important role in
the formation of brown dwarfs. Very low-mass cores would not be able to accrete
enough material to become stars, and thus they end up as brown dwarfs.

2001.08941v1,2020-01-24,2020-01-24,Symmetries and periodic orbits in simple hybrid Routhian systems,"  Symmetries are ubiquitous in a wide range of nonlinear systems. Particularly
in systems whose dynamics are determined by a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian
function. For hybrid systems which possess a continuous-time dynamics
determined by a Lagrangian function, with a cyclic variable, the degrees of
freedom for the corresponding hybrid Lagrangian system can be reduced by means
of a method known as \textit{hybrid Routhian reduction}. In this paper we study
sufficient conditions for the existence of periodic orbits in hybrid Routhian
systems which also exhibit time-reversal symmetry. Likewise, we explore some
stability aspects of such orbits through the characterization of the
eigenvalues for the corresponding linearized Poincar\'e map. Finally, we apply
the results to find periodic solutions in underactuated hybrid Routhian control
systems.

2001.09152v2,2020-01-24,2020-01-24,Distant foreground and the Planck-derived Hubble constant,"  It is possible to reduce the discrepancy between the local measurement of the
cosmological parameter $H_0$ and the value derived from the $Planck$
measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by considering
contamination of the CMB by emission from some medium around distant
extragalactic sources, such as extremely cold coarse-grain dust. Though being
distant, such a medium would still be in the foreground with respect to the
CMB, and, as any other foreground, it would alter the CMB power spectrum. This
could contribute to the dispersion of CMB temperature fluctuations. By
generating a few random samples of CMB with different dispersions, we have
checked that the increased dispersion leads to a smaller estimated value of
$H_0$, the rest of the cosmological model parameters remaining fixed. This
might explain the reduced value of the $Planck$-derived parameter $H_0$ with
respect to the local measurements. The signature of the distant foreground in
the CMB traced by SNe was previously reported by the authors of this paper --
we found a correlation between the SN redshifts, $z_{\rm SN}$, and CMB
temperature fluctuations at the SNe locations, $T_{\rm SN}$. Here we have used
the slopes of the regression lines $T_{\rm SN}\,/\,z_{\rm SN}$ corresponding to
different {\it Planck} wave bands in order to estimate the possible temperature
of the distant extragalactic medium, which turns out to be very low, about
5\,K. The most likely ingredient of this medium is coarse-grain ($grey$) dust,
which is known to be almost undetectable, except for the effect of dimming
remote extragalactic sources.

planets. While orbital properties, radii and masses of the planets are nowadays
well constrained, one of the open fascinating issues is the possibility that an
environment hospitable to life could develop on some of these planets. Here we
use a simple formulation of an energy balance model that includes the
vegetation coverage to investigate the possibility of life affecting the
climate of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system. Results confirm that planet
T-e has the best chance for a habitable world and indicate that vegetation
coverage significantly affects the resulting temperatures and habitability
properties. The influence of vegetation has been evaluated in different
scenarios characterized by different vegetation types, land-sea distributions
and levels of greenhouse effect. While changes in vegetation type produce small
changes, about $0.1\%$, in the habitable surface fraction, different land-sea
distributions, by also affecting the vegetation growth, produce different
temperature distributions. Finally at latitudes where vegetation grows, the
lowering of local albedo still represents a relevant contribution in settling
the planetary temperature profiles even when levels of greenhouse effect higher
than the Earth-like case are considered.

relevant neutrino-nucleus reaction channels at intermediate energies:
low-energy nuclear excitations, quasielastic scattering, two-nucleon knockout

  The low-energy nuclear excitations and the quasielastic peak are described
using a Hartree-Fock-CRPA (continuum random phase approximation) model that
takes into account nuclear long-range correlations as well as the distortion of
the outgoing nucleon wave function. We include two-body current mechanisms
through short-range correlations and meson-exchange currents. Their influence
on one- and two-nucleon knockout responses is computed. Bound and outgoing
nucleons are treated within the same mean-field framework. Finally, for
modeling of the neutrino-induced single-pion production, we use a low-energy
model that contains resonances and the background contributions required by
chiral symmetry. This low-energy model is combined with a Regge approach into a
Hybrid model, which allows us to make predictions beyond the resonance region.

that can be formed in current-driven nanocontacts. Here, we propose a simple
way to launch droplets in an inhomogeneous nanoscopic waveguide. We use the
drift motion of a droplet and show that in a system with broken translational
symmetry, the droplet acquires a linear momentum and propagates. We find that
the droplet velocity can be tuned via the strength of the break in symmetry and
the size of the nanocontact. In addition, we demonstrate that the launched
droplet can propagate up to several micrometers in a realistic system with
reasonable damping. Finally, we demonstrate how an annihilating droplet
delivers its momentum to a highly nonreciprocal spin-wave burst with a tunable
wave vector with nanometer wavelengths. Such a propagating droplet can be used
as a moveable spin-wave source in nanoscale magnonic networks. The presented
method enables full control of the spin-wave emission direction, which can
largely extend the freedom to design integrated magnonic circuits with a single
spin-wave source.

optimization methods. Major approximate methods, such as message passing and
graph cut techniques are also described and analyzed comprehensively. The
monograph can be useful for undergraduate and graduate students studying

VNA-FMR experiments on 20 nm (thin) and 80 nm (thick) samples confirm two type

source of large amplitude spiral spin waves, which dominate over other modes.
In case of the thinner elements, these modes are critically damped. For
different shapes of the patch, we show that a rich collection of confined

enriching the potential of the nano-dot as a spin wave emitter. We give an
explanation for the intense spiral modes from the perspective of a balance of

  measurements of the fine-structure constant","  Mapping the behaviour of dark energy is a pressing task for observational
cosmology. Phenomenological classification divides dynamical dark energy models
into freezing and thawing, depending on whether the dark energy equation of
state is approaching or moving away from $w=p/\rho=-1$. Moreover, in realistic
dynamical dark energy models the dynamical degree of freedom is expected to
couple to the electromagnetic sector, leading to variations of the
fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We discuss the feasibility of distinguishing
between the freezing and thawing classes of models with current and forthcoming
observational facilities and using a parametrisation of the dark energy
equation of state, which can have either behaviour, introduced by Mukhanov as
fiducial paradigm. We illustrate how freezing and thawing models lead to
different redshift dependencies of $\alpha$, and use a combination of current
astrophysical observations and local experiments to constrain this class of
models, improving the constraints on the key coupling parameter by more than a
factor of two, despite considering a more extended parameter space than the one
used in previous studies. We also briefly discuss the improvements expected
from future facilities and comment on the practical limitations of this class
of parametrisations. In particular, we show that sufficiently sensitive data
can distinguish between freezing and thawing models, at least if one assumes
that the relevant parameter space does not include phantom dark energy models.

  General Relativity: Effects of Magnetic Field Orientation on Jet Launching","  Binary neutron star (NSNS) mergers can be sources of gravitational waves
coincident with electromagnetic counterpart emission. To solidify their role as
multimessenger sources, we present fully 3D, general relativistic,
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spinning NSNSs initially on quasicircular
orbits that merge and undergo delayed collapse to a black hole (BH). The NSNSs
consist of two identical stars modeled as $\Gamma=2$ polytropes with spin
$\chi_{NS}= 0.36$ aligned along the direction of the total orbital angular
momentum $L$. Each star is initially threaded by a dynamical unimportant
interior dipole B-field. The field is extended into the exterior where a nearly
force-free magnetosphere resembles that of a pulsar. The magnetic dipole moment
$\mu$ is either aligned or perpendicular to $L$ and has the same initial
magnitude for each orientation. For comparison, we also impose symmetry across
the orbital plane in one case where $\mu$ in both stars is aligned along $L$.
We find that the lifetime of the transient hypermassive neutron star remnant,
the jet launching time, and the ejecta are very sensitive to the B-field
orientation. By contrast, the physical properties of the BH + disk remnant,
such as the mass and spin of the BH, the accretion rate, and the
electromagnetic luminosity, are roughly independent of the initial B-field
orientation. In addition, we find imposing symmetry across the orbital plane
does not play a significant role in the final outcome of the mergers. Our
results show that an incipient jet emerges only when the seed B-field has a
sufficiently large-scale poloidal component aligned to $L$. The lifetime
[$\Delta t\gtrsim 140(M_{NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$] and Poynting luminosities
[$L_{EM}\simeq 10^{52}$erg/s] of the jet, when it forms, are consistent with
typical short gamma-ray bursts, as well as with the Blandford--Znajek mechanism
for launching jets.

  $f(R)$ gravity","  Halo model is a physically intuitive method for modelling the non-linear
power spectrum, especially for the alternatives to the standard $\Lambda$CDM
models. In this paper, we exam the Sheth-Tormen barrier formula adopted in the
previous \texttt{CHAM} method \citep{2018MNRAS.476L..65H}. As an example, we
model the ellipsoidal collapse of top-hat dark matter haloes in $f(R)$ gravity.
A good agreement between Sheth-Tormen formula and our result is achieved. The
relative difference in the ellipsoidal collapse barrier is less than or equal
to $1.6\%$. Furthermore, we verify that, for F4 and F5 cases of Hu-Sawicki
$f(R)$ gravity, the screening mechanism do not play a crucial role in the
non-linear power spectrum modelling up to $k\sim1[h/{\rm Mpc}]$. We compare two
versions of modified gravity modelling, namely with/without screening. We find
that by treating the effective Newton constant as constant number ($G_{\rm
eff}=4/3G_N$) is acceptable. The scale dependence of the gravitational coupling
is sub-relevant. The resulting spectra in F4 and F5, are in $0.1\%$ agreement
with the previous \texttt{CHAM} results. The published code is accelerated
significantly. Finally, we compare our halo model prediction with N-body
simulation. We find that the general spectrum profile agree, qualitatively.
However, via the halo model approach, there exists a systematic
under-estimation of the matter power spectrum in the co-moving wavenumber range
between $0.3 h/{\rm Mpc}$ and $3 h/{\rm Mpc}$. These scales are overlapping
with the transition scales from two halo term dominated regimes to those of one
halo term dominated.

  diode effect","  A theoretical analysis is developed on spin-torque diode effect in nonlinear
region. An analytical solution of the diode voltage generated from spin-torque

voltage is revealed to depend nonlinearly on the phase difference between the

evaluate the phase of a spin-torque oscillator in forced synchronization state.

  uncertain renewable generations considering thermal inertia of buildings","  Insufficient flexibility in system operation caused by traditional ""heat-set""
operating modes of combined heat and power (CHP) units in winter heating
periods is a key issue that limits renewable energy consumption. In order to
reduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving the
operational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on
chance-constrained programming (CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest
generation cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated energy system (IES)
with CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative
auxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable
generations including wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic
spinning reserves are supplied in the form of chance-constrained; from the
perspective of user experience, a heating load model is built with
consideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a
solution approach based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where
the original CCP-based scheduling model is tackled into a solvable
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting a chance
constraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via
the CPLEX solver. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system
demonstrate that the presented method manages to improve operational
flexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations by comprehensively
leveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary
equipments, which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy
consumption.

2001.09262v1,2020-01-25,2020-01-25,Protective Measurements and the Reality of the Wave Function,"  It has been debated whether protective measurement implies the reality of the
wave function. In this paper, I present a new analysis of the relationship
between protective measurements and the reality of the wave function. First, I
briefly introduce protective measurements and the ontological models framework
for them. Second, I give a simple proof of Hardy's theorem in terms of
protective measurements. Third, I analyze two suggested $\psi$-epistemic models
of a protective measurement. It is shown that although these models can explain
the appearance of expectation values of observables in a single measurement,
their predictions about the variance of the result of a non-ideal protective
measurement are different from those of quantum mechanics. Finally, I argue
that under an auxiliary finiteness assumption about the dynamics of the ontic
state, protective measurement implies the reality of the wave function in the
ontological models framework.

2001.09263v1,2020-01-25,2020-01-25,The measurement problem revisited,"  It has been realized that the measurement problem of quantum mechanics is
essentially the determinate-experience problem, and in order to solve the
problem, the physical state representing the measurement result is required to
be also the physical state on which the mental state of an observer supervenes.
This necessitates a systematic analysis of the forms of psychophysical
connection in the solutions to the measurement problem. In this paper, I
propose a new, mentalistic formulation of the measurement problem which lays
more stress on psychophysical connection. By this new formulation, it can be
seen more clearly that the three main solutions to the measurement problem,
namely Everett's theory, Bohm's theory and collapse theories, correspond to
three different forms of psychophysical connection. I then analyze these forms
of psychophysical connection. It is argued that the forms of psychophysical
connection required by Everett's and Bohm's theories have potential problems,
while an analysis of how the mental state of an observer supervenes on her wave
function may help solve the structured tails problem of collapse theories.

2001.09276v1,2020-01-25,2020-01-25,Multi-operator Network Sharing for Massive IoT,"  Recent study predicts that by 2020 up to 50 billion IoT devices will be
connected to the Internet, straining the capacity of wireless network that has
already been overloaded with data-hungry mobile applications, such as
high-definition video streaming and virtual reality(VR)/augmented reality(AR).
How to accommodate the demand for both massive scale of IoT devices and
high-speed cellular services in the physically limited spectrum without
significantly increasing the operational and infrastructure costs is one of the
main challenges for operators. In this article, we introduce a new
multi-operator network sharing framework that supports the coexistence of IoT
and high-speed cellular services. Our framework is based on the radio access
network (RAN) sharing architecture recently introduced by 3GPP as a promising
solution for operators to improve their resource utilization and reduce the
system roll-out cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework
using the real base station location data in the city of Dublin collected from
two major operators in Ireland. Numerical results show that our proposed
framework can almost double the total number of IoT devices that can be
supported and coexist with other cellular services compared with the case
without network sharing.

shift of $2\pi/3$, which is independent on the tilt angle of Taiji plane

buildings is examined with the aim of investigating how the building width to
height aspect ratio affects the turbulence in the roughness sublayer and the
ventilation of the underlying street canyons. We compare the case of buildings
with a squared section with a configuration with slender buildings both in the
case of unit canyon width to height aspect ratio and in the case of AR = 2. The
former corresponds to skimming flow and the latter to wake-interference regime.
Measurements are performed in a water channel, measuring velocity on a vertical
mid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean flow, its
second-order turbulence statistics, the exchange fluxes, and the integral time
scales investigated, with results showing that slender buildings enhance
turbulence production and yield longer integral time scales in the region just
above the building roof. The combined analysis of the turbulence production
fields and the snapshots of the flow during sweep and ejection events
demonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon and the external flow is
significantly more unstable with slender buildings, mainly because the damping
effect of the vertical velocity fluctuations from the flat roof of the upwind
building is substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream) portion
of the interface is prone to the direct interaction of the external flow
structures. The higher turbulence intensity promotes the ventilation at the
canyon interface. In summary, the present experiments show that the effect of
the reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant when the urban
canopy consists of narrow canyons. The result is of interest since narrow
street canyons are typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture
of the old European city centres.

  spectroscopic surveys","  Context. Several new multi-object spectrographs are currently planned or
under construction that are capable of observing thousands of Galactic and
extragalactic objects simultaneously.
  Aims. In this paper we present a probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment
algorithm that takes spectrograph targeting constraints into account and is
capable of dealing with multiple concurrent surveys. We present this algorithm
using the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) as an example.
  Methods. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to assign probabilities to
fibre-target pairs. The assignment of probabilities takes the fibre
positioner's capabilities and constraints into account. Additionally, these
probabilities include requirements from surveys and take the required exposure
time, number density variation, and angular clustering of targets across each
survey into account. The main advantage of a probabilistic approach is that it
allows for accurate and easy computation of the target selection function for
the different surveys, which involves determining the probability of observing
a target, given an input catalogue.
  Results. The probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment allows us to achieve
maximally uniform completeness within a single field of view. The proposed
algorithm maximises the fraction of successfully observed targets whilst
minimising the selection bias as a function of exposure time. In the case of
several concurrent surveys, the algorithm maximally satisfies the scientific
requirements of each survey and no specific survey is penalised or prioritised.
  Conclusions. The algorithm presented is a proposed solution for the 4MOST
project that allows for an unbiased targeting of many simultaneous surveys.
With some modifications, the algorithm may also be applied to other
multi-object spectroscopic surveys.

2001.09385v1,2020-01-26,2020-01-26,Gravitational slingshots around black holes in a binary,"  The speed gain of a test mass from taking a gravitational slingshot around a
celestial object (scattering centre) increases with the latter's speed and
compactness (stronger deflection of the mass' trajectory becomes possible
without it hitting the surface of the object). The black holes (BHs) in a tight
binary (consisting of two black holes; we are not considering X-ray binaries),
themselves moving at relativistic speeds, represent optimal scattering centres.
Therefore, a sub-population of accreting matter particles, swept up into
chaotic orbits around a BH binary, might repeatedly take slingshots and become
accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (as seen by observers on Earth),
ultimately escaping from the binary, as well as the fate of being devoured by a
BH. The escaped particles can plausibly be observed on Earth as
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Investigating such a possibility would
require general relativistic slingshot formulae due to the high speeds involved
and the close encounters with BHs. We derive them in this paper, and show that
the percentage gain per slingshot in a particle's Lorentz factor remains

  Attacks","  Nowadays, the usage of smartphones and their applications have become rapidly
increasing popular in people's daily life. Over the last decade, availability
of mobile money services such as mobile-payment systems and app markets have
significantly increased due to the different forms of apps and connectivity
provided by mobile devices such as 3G, 4G, GPRS, and Wi-Fi, etc. In the same
trend, the number of vulnerabilities targeting these services and communication
networks has raised as well. Therefore, smartphones have become ideal target
devices for malicious programmers. With increasing the number of
vulnerabilities and attacks, there has been a corresponding ascent of the
security countermeasures presented by the researchers. Due to these reasons,
security of the payment systems is one of the most important issues in mobile
payment systems. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and
structured overview of the research on security solutions for smartphone
devices. This survey reviews the state of the art on security solutions,
threats, and vulnerabilities during the period of 2011-2017, by focusing on
software attacks, such those to smartphone applications. We outline some
countermeasures aimed at protecting smartphones against these groups of
attacks, based on the detection rules, data collections and operating systems,
especially focusing on open source applications. With this categorization, we
want to provide an easy understanding for users and researchers to improve
their knowledge about the security and privacy of smartphones.

  Data Equilibrium","  Nowadays, a huge number of images are available. However, retrieving a
required image for an ordinary user is a challenging task in computer vision
systems. During the past two decades, many types of research have been
introduced to improve the performance of the automatic annotation of images,
which are traditionally focused on content-based image retrieval. Although,
recent research demonstrates that there is a semantic gap between content-based
image retrieval and image semantics understandable by humans. As a result,
existing research in this area has caused to bridge the semantic gap between
low-level image features and high-level semantics. The conventional method of
bridging the semantic gap is through the automatic image annotation (AIA) that
extracts semantic features using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we
propose a novel AIA model based on the deep learning feature extraction method.
The proposed model has three phases, including a feature extractor, a tag
generator, and an image annotator. First, the proposed model extracts
automatically the high and low-level features based on dual-tree continues
wavelet transform (DT-CWT), singular value decomposition, distribution of color
ton, and the deep neural network. Moreover, the tag generator balances the
dictionary of the annotated keywords by a new log-entropy auto-encoder (LEAE)
and then describes these keywords by word embedding. Finally, the annotator
works based on the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network in order to obtain the
importance degree of specific features of the image. The experiments conducted
on two benchmark datasets confirm that the superiority of the proposed model
compared to the previous models in terms of performance criteria.

the multi-objective optimization (MOO) field. One way to measure algorithm
performance is through the use of benchmark functions (also called test
functions or test suites), which are artificial problems with a well-defined
mathematical formulation, known solutions and a variety of features and
difficulties. In this paper we propose a parameterized generator of scalable

that reproduce features present in other benchmarks and also problems with some
new features. We propose here the concept of generative benchmarking, in which
one can generate an infinite number of MOO problems, by varying parameters that
control specific features that the problem should have: scalability in the
number of variables and objectives, bias, deceptiveness, multimodality, robust
and non-robust solutions, shape of the Pareto front, and constraints. The
proposed Generalized Position-Distance (GPD) tunable benchmark generator uses
the position-distance paradigm, a basic approach to building test functions,
used in other benchmarks such as Deb, Thiele, Laumanns and Zitzler (DTLZ),
Walking Fish Group (WFG) and others. It includes scalable problems in any

well as electronic properties of alkali metal ion-[BMB] ion pair complexes. The
optimized [BMB] conformers are categorized into V-shaped, bent, and twisted
structures with varied electrostatic potential contours, conformational

ions have additional associations with phenyl groups in V-shaped [BMB]
conformers owing to preferential cation-$\pi$ interactions. Furthermore,
effects of molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions on thermodynamics and
microstructural properties of tetraalkylphosphonium [BMB] ILs were studied by
performing extensive atomistic interactions. Oxygen atoms in [BMB] anions have
competitive hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrogen atoms in cations

distribution in the ~100 TeV energy domain and test the validity of existing
leptonic emission models at these high energies.
  Methods: We use the novel very large zenith angle observations with the MAGIC
telescope system to increase the collection area above 10 TeV. We also develop
an auxiliary procedure of monitoring atmospheric transmission in order to
assure proper calibration of the accumulated data. This employs recording of
optical images of the stellar field next to the source position, which provides
a better than 10% accuracy for the transmission measurements.
  Results: We demonstrate that MAGIC very large zenith angle observations yield
a collection area larger than a square kilometer. In only ~56 hr of
observations, we detect the gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula up to 100
TeV, thus providing the highest energy measurement of this source to date with
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. Comparing accumulated and archival
MAGIC and Fermi/LAT data with some of the existing emission models, we find
that none of them provides an accurate description of the 1 GeV to 100 TeV
gamma-ray signal.

2001.09573v1,2020-01-27,2020-01-27,High-temperature magnetism and crystallography of a YCrO3 single crystal,"  Magnetization measurements and time-of-flight neutron powder-diffraction
studies on the high-temperature (300--980 K) magnetism and crystal structure
(321--1200 K) of a pulverized YCrO$_3$ single crystal have been performed.
Temperature-dependent inverse magnetic susceptibility coincides with a
piecewise linear function with five regimes, with which we fit a Curie-Weiss
law and calculate the frustration factor $f$. The fit results indicate a
formation of magnetic polarons between 300 and 540 K and a very strong magnetic
frustration. By including one factor $\eta$ that represents the degree of spin
interactions into the Brillouin function, we can fit well the
applied-magnetic-field dependence of magnetization. No structural phase
transition was observed from 321 to 1200 K. The average thermal expansions of
lattice configurations (\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}, and \emph{V}) obey well
the Gr$\ddot{\texttt{u}}$neisen approximations with an anomaly appearing around
900 K, implying an isosymmetric structural phase transition, and display an
anisotropic character along the crystallographic \emph{a}, \emph{b}, and
\emph{c} axes with the incompressibility $K^a_0 > K^c_0 > K^b_0$. It is
interesting to find that at 321 K, the local distortion size $\Delta$(O2)
$\approx$ 1.96$\Delta$(O1) $\approx$ 4.32$\Delta$(Y) $\approx$
293.89$\Delta$(Cr). Based on the refined Y-O and Cr-O bond lengths, we deduce
the local distortion environments and modes of Y, Cr, O1, and O2 ions.
Especially, the Y and O2 ions display obvious atomic displacement and charge
subduction, which may shed light on the dielectric property of the YCrO$_3$
compound. Additionally, by comparing Kramers Mn$^{3+}$ with non-Kramers
Cr$^{3+}$ ions, it is noted that being a Kramers or non-Kramers ion can
strongly affect the local distortion size, whereas, it may not be able to
change the detailed distortion mode.

cured by adding the alternative Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term that does not lead

application to electrochemical energy storage. Side chain engineering enables
processing of the polymer electrodes from solution, stability in aqueous
electrolytes and efficient transport of ionic and electronic charge carriers.
We synthesized a 3,3' dialkoxybithiophene homo polymer (p type polymer) with
glycol side chains and prepared naphthalene
1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-diimide-dialkoxybithiophene (NDI gT2) copolymers (n
type polymer) with either a glycol or zwitterionic side chain on the NDI unit.
For the latter, we developed a post-functionalization synthesis to attach the
polar zwitterion side chains to the polymer backbone to avoid challenges of
purifying polar intermediates. We demonstrate fast and reversible charging of
solution processed electrodes for both the p- and n type polymers in aqueous
electrolytes, without using additives or porous scaffolds and for films up to
micrometers thick. We apply spectroelectrochemistry as an in operando technique
to probe the state of charge of the electrodes. This reveals that thin films of
the p-type polymer and zwitterion n-type polymer can be charged reversibly with
up to two electronic charges per repeat unit (bipolaron formation). We combine
thin films of these polymers in a two-electrode cell and demonstrate output
voltages of up to 1.4 V with high redox stability. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of functionalizing conjugated polymers with appropriate polar side
chains to improve specific capacity, reversibility and rate capabilities of
polymer electrodes in aqueous electrolytes.

  and Na order induced electronic bands topology in NaxCoO2","  The incidence of topology on the band structure and physical properties of
layered compounds has been extensively studied in semimetals. How those evolve
in presence of electronic correlations has been less investigated so far. In
the sodium cobaltates NaxCoO2 considered here, unexpected magnetic properties
associated with correlations on the Co sites have been disclosed about 15 years
ago. The distinct Na orders of the stable phases of these cobaltates have been
shown to induce specific Co charge disproportionation with large size unit
cells in the CoO2 planes, linked with the diverse magnetic behaviors. This
provides an original playground in the studies of interplays between topology
and correlations in these layered materials. We present here transport
measurements on a series of single crystals and demonstrate that we do
synthetize pure phases with quite reproducible transport properties. We show
that above room T those display a similar behavior whatever the Na content. On
the contrary we provide evidence for a great diversity in Hall effect low
temperature dependences which underlines the specificities of the Fermi Surface
reconstructions induced by the Na order. We study in some detail the difference
between two metallic phases, one (x = 0.77) antiferromagnetic below TN = 22 K
and the second (x = 2/3) paramagnetic down to T = 0. Both show a sign change in
the Hall effect with decreasing T. We demonstrate that this can be attributed
to quite distinct physical effects. For the x = 0.77 phase the negative Hall
effect occurs in similar conditions to the anomalous Hall effect found in
various magnetic metals. In the x = 2/3 phase have to be assigned to
specificities of its Fermi surface. In both cases the anomalies detected in the
Hall effect are certainly associated with the topology of their Co electronic
bands.

spectrum and basing on the double plasma resonance model, the magnetic field
and its dynamics, electron density, and the time variation of the distance
between the stripes with harmonics s = 55 and 56 and adjacent stripes near the

G for the second harmonic of the plasma frequency) turned out to be so small

on MHD waves, and secondly, it results in large values for plasma betta (>1).
Other possible difficulties of the generation mechanism of bursts with zebra
pattern based on the double plasma resonance are also noted. Another possible
mechanism, with whistlers explains qualitatively the main observational
characteristics of this zebra. The magnetic field required in this case is
about 4.5 G, and the plasma betta is 0.14, which fully corresponds to the

2001.09954v1,2020-01-27,2020-01-27,Ten Social Dimensions of Conversations and Relationships,"  Decades of social science research identified ten fundamental dimensions that
provide the conceptual building blocks to describe the nature of human
relationships. Yet, it is not clear to what extent these concepts are expressed
in everyday language and what role they have in shaping observable dynamics of
social interactions. After annotating conversational text through
crowdsourcing, we trained NLP tools to detect the presence of these types of
interaction from conversations, and applied them to 160M messages written by
geo-referenced Reddit users, 290k emails from the Enron corpus and 300k lines
of dialogue from movie scripts. We show that social dimensions can be predicted
purely from conversations with an AUC up to 0.98, and that the combination of
the predicted dimensions suggests both the types of relationships people
entertain (conflict vs. support) and the types of real-world communities
(wealthy vs. deprived) they shape.

particle-trapping forces in a viscous fluid inside a capillary tube with
arbitrary cross section and ultrasound actuation at the walls. We find that the
acoustic fields vary axially on a length scale proportional to the square root
of the quality factor of the two-dimensional (2D) cross-section resonance mode.
This axial variation is determined analytically based on the numerical solution
to the eigenvalue problem in the 2D cross section. The analysis is developed in
two steps: First, we generalize a recently published expression for the 2D
standing-wave resonance modes in a rectangular cross section to arbitrary
shapes, including the viscous boundary layer. Second, based on these 2D modes,
we derive analytical expressions in three dimensions for the acoustic pressure,
the acoustic radiation and trapping force, as well as the acoustic energy flux
density. We validate the theory by comparison to three-dimensional numerical
simulations.

2001.09984v1,2020-01-27,2020-01-27,Universal bolometric corrections for AGN over 7 luminosity decades,"  The AGN bolometric correction is a key element to understand BH demographics
and compute accurate BH accretion histories from AGN luminosities. However,
current estimates still differ from each other by up to a factor of two to
three, and rely on extrapolations at the lowest and highest luminosities. Here
we revisit this fundamental issue presenting general hard X-ray ($K_{X}$) and
optical ($K_{O}$) bolometric corrections, computed combining several AGN
samples spanning the widest (about 7 dex) luminosity range ever used for this
kind of studies. We analysed a total of $\sim 1000$ type 1 and type 2 AGN for
which a dedicated SED-fitting has been carried out. We provide a bolometric
correction separately for type 1 and type 2 AGN; the two bolometric corrections
results to be in agreement in the overlapping luminosity range and therefore,
for the first time, a universal bolometric correction for the whole AGN sample
(both type 1 and type 2) has been computed. We found that $K_{X}$ is fairly
constant at $log(L_{BOL}/L_{\odot}) < 11$, while it increases up to about one
order of magnitude at $log(L_{BOL}/L_{\odot}) \sim 14.5$. A similar increasing
trend has been observed when its dependence on either the Eddington ratio or
the BH mass is considered, while no dependence on redshift up to $z\sim3.5$ has
been found. On the contrary, the optical bolometric correction appears to be
fairly constant (i.e. $K_{O} \sim 5$) whatever is the independent variable. We
also verified that our bolometric corrections correctly predict the AGN
bolometric luminosity functions. According to this analysis, our bolometric
corrections can be applied to the whole AGN population in a wide range of
luminosity and redshift.

missing piece to determine its full 6D phase space coordinates. We conduct a
blind search of over-densities in proper motion from Gaia DR2 in a broad region
around the Sagittarius stream by applying wavelet transform techniques. We find
that for most of the sky patches, the highest intensity peaks delineate the
path of the Sagittarius stream. The 1500 peaks identified depict a continuous
sequence spanning almost $2\pi$ in the sky, only obscured when the stream
crosses the Galactic disk. Altogether, around $100\,000$ stars potentially
belong to the stream as indicated by a coarse inspection of the
colour-magnitude diagrams. From these stars, we determine the proper motion
along the Sagittarius stream, making it the proper motion sequence with the
largest span and continuity ever measured for a stream. A first comparison with
existing N-body models of the stream reveals some discrepancies, especially
near the pericentre of the trailing arm and an overestimation of the total
proper motion for the leading arm. Our study can be the starting point for
determining the variation of the population of stars along the stream, the
distance to the stream with red clump stars, and the solar motion. It will also
allow a much better measurement of the Milky Way potential.

  conditions and protoplanet properties","  Context: Around 30 per cent of the observed exoplanets that orbit M dwarf
stars are gas giants that are more massive than Jupiter. These planets are
prime candidates for formation by disc instability. Aims: We want to determine
the conditions for disc fragmentation around M dwarfs and the properties of the
planets that are formed by disc instability. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic
simulations of M dwarf protostellar discs in order to determine the minimum
disc mass required for gravitational fragmentation to occur. Different stellar
masses, disc radii, and metallicities were considered. The mass of each
protostellar disc was steadily increased until the disc fragmented and a
protoplanet was formed. Results: We find that a disc-to-star mass ratio between
$\sim 0.3$ and $\sim 0.6$ is required for fragmentation to happen. The minimum
mass at which a disc fragments increases with the stellar mass and the disc
size. Metallicity does not significantly affect the minimum disc fragmentation
mass but high metallicity may suppress fragmentation. Protoplanets form quickly
(within a few thousand years) at distances around $\sim50$ AU from the host
star, and they are initially very hot; their centres have temperatures similar
to the ones expected at the accretion shocks around planets formed by core
accretion (up to 12,000K). The final properties of these planets (e.g. mass and
orbital radius) are determined through long-term disc-planet or planet-planet
interactions. Conclusions: Disc instability is a plausible way to form gas
giant planets around M dwarfs provided that discs have at least 30% the mass of
their host stars during the initial stages of their formation. Future
observations of massive M dwarf discs or planets around very young M dwarfs are
required to establish the importance of disc instability for planet formation
around low-mass stars.

charge movements of prestin (SLC26a5), the protein responsible for OHC

methods which did not assess the influence of dielectric loss (sensor charge
movements out of phase with voltage) that may occur, and such loss conceivably
may influence the frequency dependent activity of prestin. Here we evaluate
complex capacitance of prestin out to 30 kHz and find that its frequency
response determined using this approach coincides with all previous estimates.
We also show that membrane tension has no effect on the frequency response of
prestin, despite substantial shifts in its voltage operating range, indicating
that prestin transition rate alterations do not account for the shifts. The
magnitude roll-off of prestin activity across frequency surpasses the
reductions of NLC caused by salicylate treatments that are known to abolish
cochlear amplification. Such roll-off must therefore limit the effectiveness if
prestin in contributing to cochlear amplification at the very high acoustic
frequencies processed by some mammals.

2001.10139v1,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,The cosmic-ray content of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble,"  The nearby Orion-Eridanus superbubble, which was blown by multiple supernovae
several Myr ago, has likely produced cosmic rays. Its turbulent medium, still
energised by massive stars, can impact cosmic-ray transport locally. The gamma
rays produced in cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas were used to
compare the GeV to TeV cosmic-ray spectrum in the superbubble and in other
regions near the Sun. We used ten years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.25-63 GeV
energy range to study the closer (Eridanus) end of the superbubble. We modelled
the spatial and spectral distributions of the gamma rays produced in the
different gas phases of the clouds found in this direction. We found that the
gamma-ray emissivity spectrum of the gas along the outer rim and in a shell
inside the superbubble is consistent with the average spectrum measured in the
solar neighbourhood. This result calls for a detailed assessment of the recent
supernova rate and census of massive stellar winds in the superbubble in order
to estimate the epoch and rate of cosmic-ray production and to constrain the
transport conditions that can lead to such homogeneity and little
re-acceleration. We also found significant evidence that a diffuse cloud lying
outside the superbubble, at a height of 200-250 pc below the Galactic plane, is
pervaded by a 34\% lower cosmic-ray flux, but with the same particle energy
distribution as the local one. Super-GeV cosmic rays should freely cross such a
diffuse atomic cloud without significant loss or spectral distorsion. We
tentatively propose that the cosmic-ray loss relates to the orientation of the
magnetic field lines threading the cirrus, which point towards the halo
according to the dust polarisation data. We gathered past and present
emissivity measurements near the Sun to show how the local cosmic-ray flux
decreases with Galactic height and to compare this trend with model
predictions.

TM1e model provides a similar maximum neutron-star mass but smaller radius and
tidal deformability for a $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star, which is more consistent
with current constraints. By comparing the phase diagram and thermodynamic
quantities between EOS4 and EOS2, it is found that the TM1e model predicts

lines in quantum mechanics can be associated with the effect of continuous
distributions of magnetic fields with special symmetries. In particular, flux
lines with an arbitrary value of magnetic flux can be used to create energetic
barriers, which can be used to confine quantum systems in specially designed
configurations. This generalizes a previous work where such energy barriers
arose from flux lines with half-integer fluxons. Furthermore, it is shown how
the Landau levels can be obtained from a two-dimensional grid of flux lines.
These results suggest that the classical magnetic force can be seen as emerging
entirely from the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Finally, the basic elements of a

susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the
assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before January 25,
2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the
basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed
cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of
infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological
determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results The
basic reproduction number falls between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time
reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China,
and falls between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected
cases from colleagues. Conclusions.--The early transmission ability of
2019-nCoV is closed to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable
disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control
measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions. Notes Added.--Using
a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the
estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0].

can be reached both by particle isolation and by particle caging. The model
predicts a non-equilibrium phase diagram in which analogues of hydrodynamic and
elastic reversibility emerge at low and high volume fractions respectively,
partially separated by a diffusive, non-absorbing region. We thus find a single
phase boundary that spans the onset of chaos in sheared suspensions to the
onset of yielding in jammed packings. This boundary has the properties of a
non-equilibrium second order phase transition, leading us to write a Manna-like
mean-field description that captures the model predictions. Dependent on
contact details, jamming marks either a direct transition between the two
absorbing states, or occurs within the diffusive region.

line profiles in the velocity spectrum. Unlike the approach favoured by prior
studies, this model is not described by free parameters and we do not use
fitting procedures to match the observations. Instead, we use an analytical
turbulence model coupled with constraints extracted from a 3D hydrodynamic
simulation of the solar atmosphere. We then compare the resulting asymmetries
with their observationally derived counterpart.
  We find that stochastic excitation localised beneath the mode upper turning
point generates negative asymmetry for $\nu < \nu_\text{max}$ and positive
asymmetry for $\nu > \nu_\text{max}$. On the other hand, stochastic excitation
localised above this limit generates negative asymmetry throughout the $p$-mode
spectrum. As a result of the spatial extent of the source of excitation, both
cases play a role in the total observed asymmetries. By taking this spatial
extent into account and using a realistic description of the spectrum of
turbulent kinetic energy, both a qualitative and quantitative agreement can be
found with solar observations perfoemed by the GONG network. We also find that
the impact of the correlation between acoustic noise and oscillation is
negligible for mode asymmetry in the velocity spectrum.

wide-spread problem in interpreting experimental data measured in the tokamak

statistical analysis of nearly 400 discharges shows a strong systematic trend
in the reconstructed separatrix position relative to the VSL, where the primary
factors are plasma triangularity and the magnetic axis radial position. This
dependency is significantly reduced after the measuring coils positions as
recorded in EFIT input are optimised to provide a closer match between the
""synthetic"" coil signal calculated by the Biot-Savart law in a vacuum discharge
and the actual coil signal. In conclusion, we suggest that applying this
optimisation may lead to more accurate and reliable reconstructions of the
COMPASS equilibrium, which would have a positive impact on the accuracy of
measurement analysis performed in the edge plasma.

2001.10368v1,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,Extreme quasars as distance indicators in cosmology,"  Quasars accreting matter at very high rates (known as extreme Population A
[xA] quasars, possibly associated with super-Eddington accreting massive black
holes) may provide a new class of distance indicators covering cosmic epochs
from present day up to less than 1 Gyr from the Big Bang. At a more fundamental
level, xA quasars are of special interest in studies of the physics of AGNs and
host galaxy evolution. However, their observational properties are largely
unknown. xA quasars can be identified in relatively large numbers from major
optical surveys over a broad range of redshifts, thanks to selection criteria
defined from the systematic changes along the quasars main sequence. It has
been possible to build a sample of about 250 quasars at low and intermediate
redshift, and larger samples can be easily selected from the latest data
releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A large sample can clarify the main
properties of xA quasars which are expected - unlike the general population of
quasars - to radiate at an extreme, well defined Eddington ratio with small
scatter. As a result of the small scatter in Eddington ratio shown by xA
quasars, we propose a method to derive the main cosmological parameters based
on redshift-independent ""virial luminosity"" estimates from measurements of
emission line widths, roughly equivalent to the luminosity estimates based from
line width in early and late type galaxies. A major issue related to the
cosmological application of the xA quasar luminosity estimates from line widths
is the identification of proper emission lines whose broadening is
predominantly virial over a wide range of redshift and luminosity. We report on
preliminary developments using the AlIII 1860 intermediate ionization line and
the Hydrogen Balmer line H-beta as virial broadening estimators, and we briefly
discuss the perspective of the method based on xA quasars.

2001.10458v1,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,The K Dwarf Advantage for Biosignatures on Directly Imaged Exoplanets,"  Oxygen and methane are considered to be the canonical biosignatures of modern
Earth, and the simultaneous detection of these gases in a planetary atmosphere
is an especially strong biosignature. However, these gases may be challenging
to detect together in the planetary atmospheres because photochemical oxygen
radicals destroy methane. Previous work has shown that the photochemical
lifetime of methane in oxygenated atmospheres is longer around M dwarfs, but M
dwarf planet habitability may be hindered by extreme stellar activity and
evolution. Here, we use a 1-D photochemical-climate model to show that K dwarf
stars also offer a longer photochemical lifetime of methane in the presence of
oxygen compared to G dwarfs. For example, we show that a planet orbiting a K6V
star can support about an order of magnitude more methane in its atmosphere
compared to an equivalent planet orbiting a G2V star. In the reflected light
spectra of worlds orbiting K dwarf stars, strong oxygen and methane features
could be observed at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Because K dwarfs
are dimmer than G dwarfs, they offer a better planet-star contrast ratio,
enhancing the signal-to-noise (SNR) possible in a given observation. For
instance, a 50 hour observation of a planet at 7 pc with a 15-m telescope
yields SNR = 9.2 near 1 um for a planet orbiting a solar-type G2V star, and SNR
= 20 for the same planet orbiting a K6V star. In particular, nearby mid-late K
dwarfs such as 61 Cyg A/B, Epsilon Indi, Groombridge 1618, and HD 156026 may be
excellent targets for future biosignature searches.

also shows deviations of dust grain trajectories from the gas streamlines even

  and Other Variable Objects II","  This is the second paper of a series presenting our search for magnetic
Cataclysmic Variables (mCVs) among candidates selected mostly from the Catalina
Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS). We present the identification spectra,
obtained at the SOAR Telescope, as well as magnitudes and Gaia distances for 45
objects. Of these, 39 objects are identified as CVs, from which 8 targets show
observational characteristics of mCVs, being 7 polars and 1 intermediate polar.
The remaining 31 CVs in our sample are probably non-magnetic systems, in low
(22 systems) or high (9 systems) accretion states. Six targets of the sample
are not CVs (5 AGNs and 1 T Tauri star). Among the 8 objects with mCV spectra,
6 are new classifications. Three polars were observed in low accretion state,
either revealing photospheric features of the secondary star and allowing the
estimation of their spectral type, or presenting H$\beta$ Zeeman components
associated to the WD magnetic field. In addition to the results obtained in the
first paper of the series, and depending on the confirmation of these
classifications by observational follow-up, our results would increase the
sample of known polars by about 9 percent.

2001.10628v1,2020-01-28,2020-01-28,Topological Photonic Tamm-States and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model,"  In this paper we study the formation of topological Tamm states at the
interface between a semi-infinite one-dimensional photonic-crystal and a metal.
We show that when the system is topologically non-trivial there is a single
Tamm state in each of the band-gaps, whereas if it is topologically trivial the
band-gaps host no Tamm states. We connect the disappearance of the Tamm states
with a topological transition from a topologically non-trivial system to a
topologically trivial one. This topological transition is driven by the
modification of the dielectric functions in the unit cell. Our interpretation
is further supported by an exact mapping between the solutions of Maxwell's
equations and the existence of a tight-binding representation of those
solutions. We show that the tight-binding representation of the 1D photonic
crystal, based on Maxwell's equations, corresponds to a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type model (SSH-model) for each set of pairs of bands.
Expanding this representation near the band edge we show that the system can be
described by a Dirac-like Hamiltonian. It allows one to characterize the
topology associated with the solution of Maxwell's equations via the winding
number. In addition, for the infinite system, we provide an analytical
expression for the photonic bands from which the band-gaps can be computed.

  analysis in Einstein's and Jordan's frames","  Novel static black hole solutions with electric and magnetic charges are
derived for the class of modified gravities: $f({\cal R})={\cal
R}+2\beta\sqrt{{\cal R}}$, with or without a cosmological constant. The new
black holes behave asymptotically as flat or (A)dS space-times with a dynamical
value of the Ricci scalar given by $R=\frac{1}{r^2}$ and
$R=\frac{8r^2\Lambda+1}{r^2}$, respectively. They are characterized by three
parameters, namely their mass and electric and magnetic charges, and constitute
black hole solutions different from those in Einstein's general relativity.
Their singularities are studied by obtaining the Kretschmann scalar and Ricci
tensor, which shows a dependence on the parameter $\beta$ that is not permitted
to be zero. A conformal transformation is used to display the black holes in
Einstein's frame and check if its physical behavior is changed w.r.t. the
Jordan one. The thermal stability of the solutions is discussed by using
thermodynamical quantities, in particular the entropy, the Hawking temperature,
the quasi-local energy, and the Gibbs free energy. Also, the casual structure
of the new black holes is studied, and a stability analysis is performed in
both frames using the odd perturbations technique and the study of the geodesic
deviation. It is concluded that, generically, there is coincidence of the
physical properties of the novel black holes in both frames, although this
turns not to be the case for the Hawking temperature.

2001.10733v1,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,"An analytical double-unitary-transformation approach for strongly and
  periodically driven three-level systems","  Floquet theory combined with the generalized Van Vleck nearly degenerate
perturbation theory, has been widely employed for studying various two-level
systems that are driven by external fields via the time-dependent longitudinal
(i.e., diagonal) couplings. However, three-level systems strongly driven by the
time-dependent transverse (i.e., off-diagonal) couplings have rarely been
investigated, due to the breakdown of the traditional rotating wave
approximation. Meanwhile, the conventional perturbation theory is not directly
applicable, since a small parameter for the perturbed part is no longer
apparent. Here we develop a double-unitary-transformation approach to deal with
the periodically modulated and strongly driven systems, where the
time-dependent Hamiltonian has large off-diagonal elements. The first unitary
transformation converts the strong off-diagonal elements to the diagonal ones,
and the second enables us to harness the generalized Van Vleck perturbation
theory to deal with the transformed Floquet matrix and also allows us to reduce
the infinite-dimensional Floquet Hamiltonian to a finite effective one. For a
strongly modulated three-level system, with the combination of the Floquet
theory and the transformed generalized Van Vleck perturbation theory, we obtain
analytical results of the system, which agree well with exact numerical
solutions. This method offers a useful tool to analytically study the
multi-level systems with strong transverse couplings.

  Bilayer Graphene under Strain","  The parameters of the triangular domain wall network in bilayer graphene with
a simultaneously twisted and biaxially stretched bottom layer are studied using
the two-chain Frenkel-Kontorova model. It is demonstrated that if the graphene
layers are free to rotate, they prefer to stay co-aligned upon stretching the
bottom layer and the regular triangular network of tensile domain walls is
formed upon the commensurate-incommensurate phase transition. If the angle
between the layers is fixed, the regular triangular network of shear domain
walls is observed at zero elongation of the bottom layer. Upon stretching the
bottom layer, however, the domain walls transform into the tensile ones and the
size of the commensurate domains decreases. We also show that the parameters of
the isosceles triangular domain wall network in twisted bilayer graphene under
shear strain can be determined through purely geometrical considerations.
Experimental analysis of the orientation of domain walls and period of the
triangular network would, on the one hand, contribute to understanding of the
interlayer interaction of graphene layers, and, on the other hand, serve for
detection of relative strains and rotation between the layers. Vice versa
external strains can be used to control the parameters of the triangular domain
wall network and, therefore, electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene.

analysis of the stellar photometric time series from the Kepler mission was
interpreted as showing evidence of a large exomoon around the transiting
Jupiter-sized planet candidate Kepler-1625b. We aim to detect the radial
velocity (RV) signal imposed by Kepler-1625b (and its putative moon) on the
host star or, as the case may be, determine an upper limit on the mass of the
transiting object. We took a total of 22 spectra of Kepler-1625 using CARMENES,
20 of which were useful. Observations were spread over a total of seven nights
between October 2017 and October 2018, covering $125\%$ of one full orbit of
Kepler-1625b. We used the automatic Spectral Radial Velocity Analyser (SERVAL)
pipeline to deduce the stellar RVs and uncertainties. Then we fitted the RV
curve model of a single planet on a Keplerian orbit to the observed RVs using a
$\chi^2$ minimisation procedure. We derive upper limits on the mass of
Kepler-1625b under the assumption of a single planet on a circular orbit. In

2001.10886v1,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,A new hybrid radiative transfer method for massive star formation,"  Frequency-dependent/hybrid approaches for stellar irradiation are of primary
importance in numerical simulations of massive star formation. We seek to
compare outflow and accretion mechanisms in star formation simulations. We
investigate the accuracy of a hybrid radiative transfer method using the gray
M1 closure relation for proto-stellar irradiation and gray flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) for photons emitted everywhere else. We have coupled the FLD
module of the adaptive-mesh refinement code Ramses with Ramses-RT, which is
based on the M1 closure relation. Our hybrid (M1+FLD) method takes an average
opacity at the stellar temperature for the M1 module, instead of the local
environmental radiation field. We have tested this approach in radiative
transfer tests of disks irradiated by a star for three levels of optical
thickness and compared the temperature structure with RADMC-3D and MCFOST. We
applied it to a radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of massive star formation.
Our tests validate our hybrid approach for determining the temperature
structure of an irradiated disk in the optically-thin and moderately
optically-thick regimes and the most optically-thick test shows the limitation
of our approach. The optically-thick setups highlight the ability of the hybrid
method to partially capture the self-shielding in the disk while the FLD
cannot. The radiative acceleration is 100 times greater with the hybrid method.
It consistently leads to about +50% more extended and wider-angle radiative
outflows in the massive star formation simulation. We obtain a $17.6 M_\odot$
at $t{\simeq}0.7 \tau_\mathrm{ff}$, while the accretion phase is ongoing.
Finally, despite the use of refinement to resolve the radiative cavities, no
Rayleigh-Taylor instability appears in our simulations, and we justify their
absence by physical arguments based on the entropy gradient. (abridged)

2001.10895v1,2020-01-29,2020-01-29,Chromospheric activity in bright contact binary stars,"  Studying chromospheric activity of contact binaries is an important way of
revealing the magnetic activity processes of these systems. An efficient but
somewhat neglected method for that is to follow the changes of the H$\alpha$
line profiles via optical spectroscopy. Our goal was to perform a comprehensive
analysis based on the optical spectral signs of chromospheric activity on the
largest sample of contact binaries to date. We collected echelle spectra on 12
bright contact binaries and derived new radial velocity curves from our
observations. For quantifying the apparent chromospheric activity levels of the
systems, we subtracted self-constructed synthetic spectra from the observed
ones and measured the equivalent widths of the residual H$\alpha$-profiles at
each observed epoch. Our well-sampled data set allowed us to study the
short-term variations of chromospheric activity levels as well as to search for
correlations between them and some basic physical parameters of the systems.
Fitting the radial velocity curves, we re-determined the mass ratios and
systemic velocities of all observed objects. We found that chromospheric
activity levels of the studied systems show various changes during the orbital
revolution: we see either flat, or one-peaked, or two-peaked distributions of
equivalent width vs. the orbital phase. The first case means that the activity
level is probably constant, while the latter two cases suggest the presence of
one or two active longitudes at the stellar surfaces. Our correlation diagrams
show that mean chromospheric activity levels may be in connection with orbital
periods, B$-$V color indices, inverse Rossby numbers, and temperature
differences of the components. At the same time, no clear trend is visible with
respect to mass ratios, inclinations and fill-out factors of the systems. A-
and W-type contact binaries in our sample show similar distributions.

J0633+0632 and its wind nebula. We reveal, for the first time, pulsations of
the pulsar X-ray emission with a single sinusoidal pulse-profile and a pulsed
fraction of $23 \, \pm \, 6$ per cent in the 0.3--2 keV band. We confirm
previous Chandra findings that the pulsar X-ray spectrum consists of thermal
and non-thermal components. However, we do not find the absorption feature that
was previously detected at about 0.8 keV. Thanks to the greater sensitivity of
XMM-Newton, we get stronger constraints on spectral model parameters compared
to previous studies. The thermal component can be equally well described by
either blackbody or neutron star atmosphere models, implying that this emission
is coming from either hot pulsar polar caps with a temperature of about 120 eV
or from the colder bulk of the neutron star surface with a temperature of about
50 eV. In the latter case, the pulsar appears to be one of the coolest among
other neutron stars of similar ages with estimated surface temperatures. We
discuss cooling scenarios relevant to this neutron star. Using an interstellar
absorption--distance relation, we also constrain the distance to the pulsar to
the range of 0.7--2 kpc. Besides the pulsar and its compact nebula, we detect
regions of weak large-scale diffuse non-thermal emission in the pulsar field
and discuss their possible nature.

Keplerian circular orbits in close vicinity of rapidly spinning supermassive
black holes. Such black hole exoplanets are heated by strongly blueshifted and
focused flux of the incoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) and cooled by
the cold part of the local sky containing the black hole shadow. This gives
rise to a temperature difference, which can drive processes far from
thermodynamic equilibrium in a hypothetical life form inhabiting black hole
exoplanets, similar to the case of a planet heated by the radiation of the
parent star and cooled by the night sky. We found that for a narrow range of
radii of very low Keplerian circular orbits and for very high spin of a
supermassive black hole, the temperature regime of the black hole exoplanets
corresponds to the habitable zone around standard stars. The thermodynamics of
black hole exoplanets therefore, in principle, does not exclude the existence
of life based on known biology. The peak of the multiblackbody spectral profile
of the CMB heating the exoplanet is located in the ultraviolet band, but a
significant fraction of the flux comes also in the visible and infrared bands.
The minimum mass of a black hole ensuring the resistance to tidal disruption of

([Fe/H]=-1.60 dex), r-process-enriched ([Eu/Fe]=0.73 dex) halo star HD 20 using
novel and archival high-resolution spectra at outstanding signal-to-noise
ratios. By combining one of the first asteroseismic gravity measurements in the
metal-poor regime from a TESS light curve with non-LTE analyses of iron lines,
we derive a set of highly accurate and precise stellar parameters. These allow
us to delineate a chemical pattern comprised of solid detections of 48
elements, including 28 neutron-capture elements, which establishes HD 20 among
the few benchmark stars that have almost complete patterns with low systematic
dependencies on the stellar parameters. Our light-element (Z<30) abundances are
representative of other, similarly metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo with
contributions from core-collapse supernovae of type II. A comparison to the
scaled solar r-pattern shows that the lighter neutron-capture elements
(37<Z<60) are poorly matched. In particular, we find imprints of the weak
r-process acting at low metallicities. Nonetheless, by comparing our detailed
abundances to the observed metal-poor star BD +17 3248, we find a persistent
residual pattern that is indicative of enrichment contributions from the
s-process. We show that mixing with material from predicted yields of massive,
rotating AGB stars at low metallicity considerably improves the fit. Based on a
solar ratio of heavy- to light-s elements -- at odds with model predictions for
the i-process -- and a missing clear residual pattern with respect to other
stars with claimed contributions from this process, we refute (strong)
contributions from such astrophysical sites providing intermediate neutron
densities. Finally, nuclear cosmochronology is used to tie our detection of the

  embedded planets","  Nearly-axisymmetric gaps and rings are commonly observed in protoplanetary
discs. The leading theory regarding the origin of these patterns is that they
are due to dust trapping at the edges of gas gaps induced by the gravitational
torques from embedded planets. If the concentration of solids at the gap edges
becomes high enough, it could potentially result in planetesimal formation by
the streaming instability. We test this hypothesis by performing global 1-D
simulations of dust evolution and planetesimal formation in a protoplanetary
disc that is perturbed by multiple planets. We explore different combinations
of particle sizes, disc parameters, and planetary masses, and find that
planetesimals form in all these cases. We also compare the spatial distribution
of pebbles from our simulations with protoplanetary disc observations. Planets
larger than one pebble isolation mass catch drifting pebbles efficiently at the
edge of their gas gaps, and depending on the efficiency of planetesimal
formation at the gap edges, the protoplanetary disc transforms within a few
100,000 years to either a transition disc with a large inner hole devoid of
dust or to a disc with narrow bright rings. For simulations with planetary
masses lower than the pebble isolation mass, the outcome is a disc with a
series of weak ring patterns but no strong depletion between the rings.
Lowering the pebble size artificially to 100 micrometer-sized ""silt"", we find
that regions between planets get depleted of their pebble mass on a longer
time-scale of up to 0.5 million years. These simulations also produce fewer
planetesimals than in the nominal model with millimeter-sized particles and
always have at least two rings of pebbles still visible after 1 Myr.

  the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation","  Demographic surveys of protoplanetary disks, carried out mainly with ALMA,
have provided access to a large range of disk dust masses ($M_{\rm{dust}}$)
around stars with different stellar types and in different star-forming
regions. These surveys found a power-law relation between $M_{\rm{dust}}$ and
$M_{\star}$ that steepens in time, but which is also flatter for transition
disks (TDs). We performed dust evolution models, which included perturbations
to the gas surface density with different amplitudes to investigate the effect
of particle trapping on the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation. These
perturbations were aimed at mimicking pressure bumps that originated from
planets. We focused on the effect caused by different stellar and disk masses
based on exoplanet statistics that demonstrate a dependence of planet mass on
stellar mass and metallicity. Models of dust evolution can reproduce the
observed $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation in different star-forming regions
when strong pressure bumps are included and when the disk mass scales with
stellar mass (case of $M_{\rm{disk}}=0.05\,M_\star$ in our models). This result
arises from dust trapping and dust growth beyond centimeter-sized grains inside
pressure bumps. However, the flatter relation of $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ for
TDs and disks with substructures cannot be reproduced by the models unless the
formation of boulders is inhibited inside pressure bumps. In the context of
pressure bumps originating from planets, our results agree with current
exoplanet statistics on giant planet occurrence increasing with stellar mass,
but we cannot draw a conclusion about the type of planets needed in the case of
low-mass stars. This is attributed to the fact that for $M_\star<1\,M_\odot$,
the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}$ obtained from models is very low due to the
efficient growth of dust particles beyond centimeter-sizes inside pressure
bumps.

  Spaces","  When the dynamics of a system are difficult to model and/or time-consuming to
evaluate, such as in deformable object manipulation tasks, motion planning
algorithms struggle to find feasible plans efficiently. Such problems are often
reduced to state spaces where the dynamics are straightforward to model and
evaluate. However, such reductions usually discard information about the system
for the benefit of computational efficiency, leading to cases where the true
and reduced dynamics disagree on the result of an action. This paper presents a
formulation for planning in reduced state spaces that uses a classifier to bias
the planner away from state-action pairs that are not reliably feasible under
the true dynamics. We present a method to generate and label data to train such
a classifier, as well as an application of our framework to rope manipulation,
where we use a Virtual Elastic Band (VEB) approximation to the true dynamics.
Our experiments with rope manipulation demonstrate that the classifier
significantly improves the success rate of our RRT-based planner in several
difficult scenarios which are designed to cause the VEB to produce incorrect
predictions in key parts of the environment.

  Other Systems Under Broadband Control","  Most future quantum devices, including quantum computers, require control
that is broadband, meaning that the rate of change of the time-dependent
Hamiltonian is as fast or faster than the dynamics it generates. In many areas
of quantum physics, including quantum technology, one must include dissipation
and decoherence induced by the environment. While Markovian master equations
provide the only really efficient way to model these effects, these master
equations are derived for constant Hamiltonians (or those with a discrete set
of well-defined frequencies). In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A
73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovian
master equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despite
apparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations are
routinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs is
likely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulations
of two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtain
quantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian master
equations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, we
find that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Master
equations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies and
bandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transition
frequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as large
as the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does not
overlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accurate
descriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomic
systems.

excitation with dispersionless (zero-dimensional) phonons. On the example of a
lattice model with Peierls-type excitation-phonon interaction, such
level-crossing-type small-polaron transitions are analyzed here through the
prism of the entanglement spectrum of the excitation-phonon system. By
evaluating this spectrum in a numerically-exact fashion it is demonstrated that
the behavior of the entanglement entropy in the vicinity of the critical
excitation-phonon coupling strength chiefly originates from one specific
entanglement-spectrum eigenvalue, namely the smallest one. While the discrete
translational symmetry of the system implies that those eigenvalues can be
labeled by the bare-excitation quasimomentum quantum numbers, here it is shown

2001.11252v1,2020-01-30,2020-01-30,RASCAS: RAdiation SCattering in Astrophysical Simulations,"  Resonant lines are powerful probes of the interstellar and circumgalactic
medium of galaxies. Their transfer in gas being a complex process, the
interpretation of their observational signatures, either in absorption or in
emission, is often not straightforward. Numerical radiative transfer
simulations are needed to accurately describe the travel of resonant line
photons in real and in frequency space, and to produce realistic mock
observations. This paper introduces RASCAS, a new public 3D radiative transfer
code developed to perform the propagation of any resonant line in numerical
simulations of astrophysical objects. RASCAS was designed to be easily
customisable and to process simulations of arbitrarily large sizes on large
supercomputers. RASCAS performs radiative transfer on an adaptive mesh with an
octree structure using the Monte Carlo technique. RASCAS features full MPI
parallelisation, domain decomposition, adaptive load-balancing, and a standard
peeling algorithm to construct mock observations. The radiative transport of
resonant line photons through different mixes of species (e.g. \ion{H}{i},
\ion{Si}{ii}, \ion{Mg}{ii}, \ion{Fe}{ii}), including their interaction with
dust, is implemented in a modular fashion to allow new transitions to be easily
added to the code. RASCAS is very accurate and efficient. It shows perfect
scaling up to a minimum of a thousand cores. It has been fully tested against
radiative transfer problems with analytic solutions and against various test
cases proposed in the literature. Although it was designed to describe
accurately the many scatterings of line photons, RASCAS may also be used to
propagate photons at any wavelength (e.g. stellar continuum or fluorescent
lines), or to cast millions of rays to integrate the optical depths of ionising
photons, making it highly versatile.

biomedical science and engineering. Pulmonary air flow and vascular blood flow
are usually laminar, because shear forces acting on the physiological system
ought to be small. However, frictional losses and shear stresses vary
considerably with transition to turbulence. This plays an important role in
cases of e.g. artificial respiration or stenosis. On the other hand, in piston
engines and reciprocating thermal/chemical process devices, turbulent or
transitional oscillatory flows affect mixing properties, and also mass and heat
transfer. In contrast to the extensively investigated statistically steady wall
bounded shear flows, rather little work has been devoted to the onset,
amplification and decay of turbulence in pipe flows driven by an unsteady
external force. Experiments [1, 3, 6] indicate that transition to turbulence
depends on only one parameter, i.e. Re_{\delta} \sim Re/Wo with a critical
value of about 550, at least for Womersley numbers Wo > 7. We perform direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of oscillatory pipe flows at several combinations
of Re and Wo to extend the validity of this critical value to higher Wo. To
better understand the physical mechanisms involved during decay and
amplification of the turbulent flow, we further analyse the turbulent kinetic
energy distribution and its budgets terms.

galaxies by presenting the first complete volume-limited sample of slow
rotators with both integral-field kinematics from the ATLAS3D Project and high
spatial resolution photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope. Analysing the
nuclear surface brightness profiles of 12 newly imaged slow rotators, we
classify their light profiles as core-less, and place an upper limit to the
core size of ~10 pc. Considering the full magnitude and volume-limited ATLAS3D
sample, we correlate the presence or lack of cores with stellar kinematics,
including the proxy for the stellar angular momentum and the velocity
dispersion within one half-light radius, stellar mass, stellar age,
$\alpha$-element abundance, and age and metallicity gradients. More than half
of the slow rotators have core-less light profiles, and they are all less
massive than $10^{11}$ Msun. Core-less slow rotators show evidence for
counter-rotating flattened structures, have steeper metallicity gradients, and
a larger dispersion of gradient values than core slow rotators. Our results
suggest that core and core-less slow rotators have different assembly
processes, where the former are the relics of massive dissipation-less merging
in the presence of central supermassive black holes. Formation processes of
core-less slow rotators are consistent with accretion of counter-rotating gas
or gas-rich mergers of special orbital configurations, which lower the final
net angular momentum of stars, but support star formation. We also highlight
core fast rotators as galaxies that share properties of core slow rotators and
core-less slow rotators. Formation processes similar to those for core-less
slow rotators can be invoked to explain the assembly of core fast rotators,
with the distinction that these processes form or preserve cores.[Abridged]

if this variability is purely random or to some extent predictable. Here we
show, by employing machine learning techniques such as regression neural
networks and support vector machines that deformation predictability evolves
with strain and crystal size. Using data from discrete dislocations dynamics
simulations, the machine learning models are trained to infer the mapping from
features of the pre-existing dislocation configuration to the stress-strain
curves. The predictability vs strain relation is non-monotonic and exhibits a
system size effect: larger systems are more predictable. Stochastic deformation
avalanches give rise to fundamental limits of deformation predictability for
intermediate strains. However, the large-strain deformation dynamics of the
samples can be predicted surprisingly well.

  Autoencoder","  The development of models for quality prediction of both audio and video
signals is a fairly mature field. But, although several multimodal models have
been proposed, the area of audio-visual quality prediction is still an emerging
area. In fact, despite the reasonable performance obtained by combination and
parametric metrics, currently there is no reliable pixel-based audio-visual
quality metric. The approach presented in this work is based on the assumption
that autoencoders, fed with descriptive audio and video features, might produce
a set of features that is able to describe the complex audio and video
interactions. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a No-Reference Audio-Visual
Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd). The model visual features
are natural scene statistics (NSS) and spatial-temporal measures of the video
component. Meanwhile, the audio features are obtained by computing the
spectrogram representation of the audio component. The model is formed by a
2-layer framework that includes a deep autoencoder layer and a classification
layer. These two layers are stacked and trained to build the deep neural
network model. The model is trained and tested using a large set of stimuli,
containing representative audio and video artifacts. The model performed well
when tested against the UnB-AV and the LiveNetflix-II databases. %Results shows
that this type of approach produces quality scores that are highly correlated
to subjective quality scores.

2001.11410v1,2020-01-30,2020-01-30,The Tucana dwarf spheroidal galaxy: not such a massive failure after all,"  Isolated Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies have evolved most or all of their
life unaffected by interactions with the large LG spirals and therefore offer
the opportunity to learn about the intrinsic characteristics of this class of
objects. Here we explore the internal kinematic and metallicity properties of
one of the three isolated LG dwarf spheroidal galaxies, i.e. the Tucana dSph.
This is an intriguing system, as it has been found in the literature to have an
internal rotation of up to 16 km/s, a much higher velocity dispersion than
other dSphs of similar luminosity, and a possible exception to the
too-big-too-fail problem. We present results for a new VLT/FORS2 spectroscopic
dataset in the CaII triplet region for 50 candidate red giant branch stars in
the direction of Tucana, which yielded line-of-sight velocity and metallicity
([Fe/H]) measurements of 39 effective members. This doubles the number of
Tucana's stars with such measurements. In addition, we re-reduce and include in
our analysis the other two spectroscopic datasets presented in the literature,
the VLT/FORS2 sample by Fraternali et al. (2009) and the VLT/FLAMES one by
Gregory et al. (2019). We measure a systemic velocity of $180.0\pm1.3$ km/s,
consistently across the various datasets analyzed, and find that a
dispersion-only model is moderately favored over models accounting also for
internal rotation. Our best estimate of the internal velocity dispersion is
$6.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s, much smaller than the values reported in the
literature and in line with similarly luminous dSphs; this is consistent with
Tucana not being an exception to the too-big-to-fail problem, nor living in a
dark matter halo much more massive than those of its siblings. As for the
metallicity properties, we do not find anything unusual; there are hints of the
presence of a [Fe/H] gradient but more data are needed to pin its presence
down.

line equivalent width in order to detect the faintest extragalactic emission
line systems. In this way, OTELO data will complements other broad-band,
narrow-band, and spectroscopic surveys. The red tunable filter of the OSIRIS
instrument on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) is used to scan a
spectral window centred at $9175 \AA$, which is free from strong sky emission
lines, with a sampling interval of $6 \AA$ and a bandwidth of $12 \AA$ in the
most deeply explored Extended Groth Strip region. Careful data reduction using
improved techniques for sky ring subtraction, accurate astrometry, photometric
calibration, and source extraction enables us to compile the OTELO catalogue.
This catalogue is complemented with ancillary data ranging from deep X-ray to
far-infrared, including high resolution HST images, which allow us to segregate
the different types of targets, derive precise photometric redshifts, and
obtain the morphological classification of the extragalactic objects detected.
The OTELO multi-wavelength catalogue contains 11237 entries and is 50\%
complete at AB magnitude 26.38. Of these sources, 6600 have photometric
redshifts with an uncertainty $z_{phot}$ better than $0.2 (1+z_{phot})$. A
total of 4336 of these sources correspond to preliminary emission line
candidates, which are complemented by 81 candidate stars and 483 sources that
qualify as absorption line systems. The OTELO survey products were released to
the public on 2019.

  angular momentum II. Test of a revised prescription for transport by the
  Tayler instability","  Context: Asteroseismic measurements reveal that an unknown efficient angular
momentum (AM) transport mechanism is needed for subgiant and red giant stars. A
revised prescription for AM transport by the magnetic Tayler instability has
been recently proposed as a possible candidate for such a missing mechanism.
  Results: The revised prescription for the transport by the Tayler instability
leads to low core rotation rates after the main sequence that are in better
global agreement with asteroseismic measurements than those predicted by models
with purely hydrodynamic processes or with the original Tayler-Spruit dynamo. A
detailed comparison with asteroseismic data shows that the rotational
properties of at most two of the six subgiants can be correctly reproduced by
models accounting for this revised magnetic transport process. This result is
obtained independently of the value adopted for the calibration parameter in
this prescription. We also find that this transport by the Tayler instability
faces difficulties in simultaneously reproducing asteroseismic measurements
available for subgiant and red giant stars. The low values of the calibration
parameter needed to correctly reproduce the rotational properties of two of the
six subgiants lead to core rotation rates during the red giant phase that are
too high. Inversely, the higher values of this parameter needed to reproduce
the core rotation rates of red giants lead to a very low degree of radial
differential rotation before the red giant phase, which is in contradiction
with the internal rotation of subgiant stars.
  Conclusions: In its present form, the revised prescription for the transport
by the Tayler instability does not provide a complete solution to the missing
AM transport revealed by asteroseismology of evolved stars.

  electromagnetic radiation and its application to the $α-\mathcal{T}_3$
  graphene model","  In a system with a Dirac-like linear dispersion there are always states that
fulfill the resonance condition for electromagnetic radiation of arbitrary
frequency $\Omega$. When a flat band is present two kinds of resonant
transitions are found. Considering the $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ graphene model as
a minimal model with a flat band and Dirac cones, and describing the dynamics
using the interaction picture, we study the band transitions induced by an
external electromagnetic field. We found that transitions depend upon the
relative angle between the electron momentum and the electromagnetic field wave
vector. For parallel incidence, the transitions are found using Floquet theory
while for other angles perturbation theory is used. In all cases, the
transition probabilities and the frequencies are found. For some special values
of the parameter $\alpha$ or by charge doping, the system behaves as a three
level or a two-level Rabi system. All these previous results were compared with
numerical simulations. A good agreement was found between both. The obtained
results are useful to provide a quantum control of the system.

The interactions can take the form of two short waves with different

as finding simple steady patterns when the waves reinforce each other, we can
also find spatially complex but steady patterns, including quasipatterns. When
the waves compete with each other, time varying states such as spatiotemporal

encouraged, as we confirm through extensive numerical simulation. Our arguments
allow us to predict when spatiotemporal chaos might be found: standard
nonlinear methods fail in this case. The arguments are quite general and apply

recombination era. Observations seem to favor the scenario where massive stars
generating photons in low-mass galaxies were responsible for the bulk of
reionization. Even though a possible contribution from accretion disks of
active galactic nuclei (AGN) has been widely considered, they are currently
thought to have had a minor role in reionization. Our aim is to study the
possibility that AGN contributed to reionization not only through their
accretion disks, but also through ionizing photons coming from the AGN jets
interacting with the IGM. We adopt an empirically derived AGN luminosity
function at $z\simeq6$, use X-ray observations to correct it for the presence
of obscured sources, and estimate the density of jetted AGN. We then use
analytical calculations to derive the fraction of jet energy that goes into
ionizing photons. Finally, we compute the contribution of AGN jets to the H II
volume filling factor at redshifts $z\simeq15-5$. We show that the contribution
of the AGN jet lobes to the reionization of the Universe at $z\sim6$ might have
been as high as $\gtrsim 10$\% of that of star-forming galaxies, under the most
favorable conditions of jetted and obscuration fraction. The contribution of
AGN to the reionization, while most likely not dominant, could have been higher
than previously assumed, thanks to the radiation originated in the jet lobes.

early decline optical spectra, cast doubts on their true nature and whether
nova impostors might exist. We monitored a candidate nova which displayed a
distinctly unusual light curve at maximum and early decline through optical
spectroscopy (3000-10000 \AA, 500<R<100000) complemented with Swift UV and
AAVSO optical photometry. We use the spectral line series to characterize the
ejecta dynamics, structure, and mass. We found that the ejecta are in free
ballistic expansion and structured as typical of classical novae. However,
their derived mass is at least an order of magnitude larger than the typical
ejecta masses obtained for classical novae. Specifically, we found
M$_{ej}\simeq$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ independent of the distance for a
filling factor $\varepsilon$=1. By constraining the distance we derived
$\varepsilon$ in the range 0.08-0.10, giving a mass 7$\times$10$^{-4}\lesssim$
M$_{ej}\lesssim$9$\times$10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$. The nebular spectrum,
characterized by unusually strong coronal emission lines, confines the ionizing
source energy to the range 20-250 eV, possibly peaking in the range 75-100 or
75-150 eV. We link this source to other slow novae which showed similar
behavior and suggest that they might form a distinct physical sub-group. They
may result from a classical nova explosion occurring on a very low mass white
dwarf or be impostors for an entirely different type of transient.

variety of MCs is divided in ensembles according to the PDF slope and each
ensemble is represented by a single spherical cloud. The cores are considered
as elements of self-similar structure typical for fractal clouds and are
modeled by spherical objects populating each cloud shell. Our model assumes
relations between size, mass and density of the statistical cores. Out of them
a core mass-density relationship $\rho\propto m^x$ is derived where
$x=1/(1+q)$. We found that $q$ determines the existence or non-existence of a
threshold density for core collapse. The derived general CMF is a power law of
slope $-1$ while the CMF of gravitationally unstable cores has a slope $(-1 +
x/2)$, comparable with the slopes of the high-mass part of the stellar initial

finding that both distributions are best fit by two populations, a CN-enhanced
and CN-normal. We find that 42 $\pm$ 4\% of the RGB stars in our sample are
CN-enhanced. The percentage of CN-enhanced is 40 $\pm$ 13\% for the AGB and 33
$\pm$ 9\% for the HB stars, which suggests there are no missing second
generation stars at these stages of stellar evolution. The two generations also
separate in magnitude and color on the HB, which allows us to find the
difference in He abundance between the two populations by fitting appropriate
ZAHBs. The broad range of distances from the cluster's center covered by our
sample allows us to study the dependence of the ratio of the number of first to
second population stars on the distance from the cluster's center, and we find
that this ratio does not vary radially and that the two populations are

separated oscillating magnetic fields with ultracold neutrons (UCN). Our
measurement stands in the long history of EDM experiments probing physics
violating time reversal invariance. The salient features of this experiment
were the use of a Hg-199 co-magnetometer and an array of optically pumped
cesium vapor magnetometers to cancel and correct for magnetic field changes.
The statistical analysis was performed on blinded datasets by two separate
groups while the estimation of systematic effects profited from an
unprecedented knowledge of the magnetic field. The measured value of the
neutron EDM is $d_{\rm n} = (0.0\pm1.1_{\rm stat}\pm0.2_{\rm
sys})\times10^{-26}e\,{\rm cm}$.

supercurrents in the two models. We exhibit a similarity transformation that
maps the free-field supersymmetric PT-symmetric Dirac model to a supersymmetric
Hermitian theory, but there is in general no corresponding similarity
transformation for the Majorana model. In this model we find generically a mass
splitting between bosons and fermions, even though its construction is
explicitly supersymmetric, offering a novel non-Hermitian mechanism for soft
supersymmetry breaking.

substance in the jet, is applied to quantitatively analyze integrated
intensities of the luminescence bands of the neutral and charged excimer

spectroscopically find two ranges of average sizes of Ar, Kr, and Xe

assigned to quasicrystalline icosahedral and crystalline fcc structures in

nebulae (PNe), and nova and supernova remnants, among others, allow us to
constrain their physical characteristics, such as size, mass, luminosity, and
age. An innovative technique based on the expansion parallax method, the
so-called distance mapping technique (DMT), provides distance maps of expanding
nebulae as well as an estimation of their distances. The DMT combines the
tangential velocity vectors obtained from 3D morpho-kinematic models and the
observed proper motion vectors to estimate the distance. We applied the DMT to
four PNe (NGC 6702, NGC 6543, NGC 6302, and BD+30 3639) and one nova remnant
(GK Persei) and derived new distances in good agreement with previous studies.
New simple morpho-kinematic shape models were generated for NGC 6543, NGC 6302,
and NGC 6702, whereas for BD+30 3639 and GK Persei published models were used.
We demonstrate that the DMT is a useful tool to obtain distance values of PNe,
in addition to revealing kinematically peculiar regions within the nebulae.
Distances are also derived from the trigonometric Gaia parallaxes. The effect
of the non-negligible parallax offset in the second Gaia data release is also
discussed.

  dimming control","  The main objectives in driving multiple LED strings include achieving uniform
current control and high performance PWM dimming for all strings. This work
proposes a new multiple string LED driver to achieve not only current balance,
but also flexible and wide range PWM dimming ratio for each string. A compact
single-inductor multiple-output topology is adopted in the driver, accompanied
by synchronous integrators and variable dimming frequency, to achieve both high
efficiency and high performance dimming. By using the proposed variable dimming
frequency scheme, high dimming frequency is applied to a string with high
dimming ratio, which helps to maintain the deviation of LED string current in
an acceptable range, while low dimming frequency is applied to a string with
low dimming ratio, which helps to achieve rectangular LED current waveform.
Meanwhile, the new time multiplexing control scheme automatically optimizes the
LED string's bus voltages, thus minimizes each string's power loss. A three
string LED driver prototype is constructed to validate the effectiveness of the
peoposed control scheme, where the three strings can have different dimming
ratios between 4% and 100%.

power resources. A number of attacks aim to exhaust these resources and drain
the batteries of such edge nodes. In this work, we study the effects of a
variety of battery draining attacks against edge nodes. Through simulation, we
clarify the extent to which such attacks are able to increase the usage and
hence waste the power resources of edge nodes. Specifically, we implement hello
flooding, packet flooding, selective forwarding, rank attack, and versioning
attack in ContikiOS and simulate them in the Cooja simulator, and measure and
report a number of time and power resource usage metrics including CPU time,
low power mode time, TX/RX time, and battery consumption. Besides, we test the
stretch attack with three different batteries as an extreme scenario. Our
extensive measurements enable us to compare the effectiveness of these attacks.
Our results show that Versioning attack is the most severe attack in terms of
draining the power resources of the network, followed by Packet Flooding and
Hello Flood attacks. Furthermore, we confirm that Selective Forwarding and Rank
attacks are not able to considerably increase the power resource usage in our
scenarios. By quantifying the effects of these attacks, we demonstrate that
under specific scenarios, Versioning attack can be three to four times as
effective as Packet Flooding and Hello Flood attacks in wasting network
resources, while Packet Flooding is generally comparable to Hello Flood in CPU
and TX time usage increase but twice as powerful in draining device batteries.

nature: they arise because of the auto-correlation of a complex scattering
amplitude and due to spatial coherence of the incoming wave packets. Both these
effects are neglected in a conventional scattering theory dealing with the
delocalized plane waves, although they sometimes must be taken into account in
particle and atomic physics. Here, we study the role of a transverse coherence
length of the packets, putting special emphasis on the case in which one of the
particles is twisted, that is, it carries an orbital angular momentum
$\ell\hbar$. In $ee, ep$, and $pp$ collisions the interference results in
corrections to the plane-wave cross sections, usually negligible at the
energies $\sqrt{s} \gg 1$ GeV but noticeable for smaller ones, especially if
there is a twisted hadron with $|\ell| > 10^3$ in initial state. Beyond the
perturbative QCD, these corrections become only moderately attenuated allowing
one to probe a phase of the hadronic amplitude as a function of $s$ and $t$. In
this regime, the coherence effects can compete with the loop corrections in QED
and facilitate testing the phenomenological models of the strong interaction at
intermediate and low energies.

thermal conductivity whose further improvement has attracted a lot of interest.
Some theoretical studies have suggested that the thermal conductivity of a
$(10,10)$ SWCNT is dramatically enhanced by C$_{60}$ fullerene encapsulation.
However, recent experiments on SWCNT bundles show that fullerene encapsulation
leads to a reduction rather than an increase in thermal conductivity. Here, we
employ three different molecular dynamics methods to study the influence of
C$_{60}$ encapsulation on heat transport in a $(10,10)$ SWCNT. All the three
methods consistently predict a reduction of the thermal conductivity of
$(10,10)$ SWCNT upon C$_{60}$ encapsulation by $20\%-30\%$, in agreement with
experimental results on bundles of SWCNTs. We demonstrate that there is a
simulation artifact in the Green-Kubo method which gives anomalously large
thermal conductivity from artificial convection. Our results show that the
C$_{60}$ molecules conduct little heat compared to the outer SWCNT and reduce
the phonon mean free paths of the SWCNT by inducing extra phonon scattering. We
also find that the thermal conductivity of a $(10,10)$ SWCNT monotonically
decreases with increasing filling ratio of C$_{60}$ molecules.

algorithm, all features of each sample are superposed by a certain quantum
state through the \emph{CMP} and \emph{rotation} operations, then the

similarity between two samples. After that, \emph{Near-hit} and

further applied to update the feature weight vector $WT$ to get $WT'$ that
determine the relevant features with the threshold $\tau$. In order to verify

  Environment","  Cloud computing is a powerful and popular information technology paradigm
that enables data service outsourcing and provides higher-level services with
minimal management effort. However, it is still a key challenge to protect data
privacy when a user accesses the sensitive cloud data. Privacy-preserving
database query allows the user to retrieve a data item from the cloud database
without revealing the information of the queried data item, meanwhile limiting
user's ability to access other ones. In this study, in order to achieve the
privacy preservation and reduce the communication complexity, a quantum-based
database query scheme for privacy preservation in cloud environment is
developed. Specifically, all the data items of the database are firstly
encrypted by different keys for protecting server's privacy, and in order to
guarantee the clients' privacy, the server is required to transmit all these
encrypted data items to the client with the oblivious transfer strategy.
Besides, two oracle operations, a modified Grover iteration, and a special
offset encryption mechanism are combined together to ensure that the client can
correctly query the desirable data item. Finally, performance evaluation is
conducted to validate the correctness, privacy, and efficiency of our proposed
scheme.

fascinating quantum hydrodynamics with important scientific and engineering
applications. However, the lack of high-precision flow measurement tools in He
II has impeded the progress in understanding and utilizing its hydrodynamics.
In recent years, there have been extensive efforts in developing quantitative
flow visualization techniques applicable to He II. In particular, a powerful
molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) technique, based on tracking thin lines of
He$^*_2$ excimer molecules created via femtosecond laser-field ionization in
helium, has been developed in our lab. This technique allows unambiguous
measurement of the normal-fluid velocity field in the two-fluid system.
Nevertheless, there are two limitations of this technique: 1) only the velocity
component perpendicular to the tracer line can be measured; and 2) there is an
inherent error in determining the perpendicular velocity. In this paper, we
discuss how these issues can be resolved by advancing the MTV technique. We
also discuss two novel schemes for tagging and producing He$^*_2$ tracers. The
first method allows the creation of a tagged He$^*_2$ tracer line without the
use of an expensive femtosecond laser. The second method enables full-space
velocity field measurement through tracking small clouds of He$^*_2$ molecules
created via neutron-$^3$He absorption reactions in He II.

following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and their effects in
Fukushima, Japan. Flying lower and slower than manned aircraft, an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) can provide improved spatial resolution. In particular,
hot spot activity can be underestimated in manned survey results as the higher
flight altitude and wider line spacing effectively average the hot spot over a
larger area. Moreover, a UAV can enter an area which is hazardous for humans.
NRCan has been investigating the inclusion of UAV-borne radiation survey
spectrometers into its aerial survey response procedures. The Advanced
Radiation Detector for UAV Operations (ARDUO) was developed to exploit the
flight and lift capabilities available in the under 25kg class of UAVs. The
detector features eight 2.8cm x 2.8cm x 5.6cm CsI(Tl) crystals in a
self-shielding configuration, read out with silicon photomultipliers and
digitized using miniaturized custom electronics. The ARDUO is flown on a main-
and tail-rotor UAV called Responder which has a 6kg lift capacity and up to
40min. endurance. The performance of the ARDUO-Responder UAV system was
characterized in both lab and outdoor trials. Outdoor trials consisted of
aerial surveys over sealed point sources and over a distributed source. Results
show how the directional response of the ARDUO can provide an indication in
real time of source location for in-flight guidance. As well, the results show

into future ringdown tests of general relativity with third-generation
gravitational wave detectors to avoid systematic biases. We find that, although
little information can be gained about the kick for existing gravitational wave
events, interesting measurements will soon become possible as detectors
improve. We show that, once LIGO and Virgo reach their design sensitivities, we
will reliably extract the kick velocity for generically precessing
binaries--including the so-called superkicks, reaching up to 5000 km/s.

that the bimeron energy increases with $Q_{\text{v}}$, and the energy of an

the dynamics of frustrated bimerons driven by the spin-orbit torques, which

mergers. The bursting rate for repeaters could be very high and the emission
site is likely from a magnetosphere. We discuss a hypothesis of producing
abundant repeating FRBs in BNS systems. Decades to centuries before a BNS
system coalesces, the magnetospheres of the two neutron stars start to interact
relentlessly. Abrupt magnetic reconnection accelerates particles, which emit
coherent radio waves in bunches via curvature radiation. FRBs are detected as
these bright radiation beams point towards Earth. This model predicts
quasi-periodicity of the bursts at the rotation periods of the two merging
neutron stars (tens of milliseconds and seconds, respectively) as well as the
period of orbital motion (of the order of 100 s). The bursting activities are
expected to elevate with time as the two neutron stars get closer. The
repeating FRB sources should be gravitational wave (GW) sources for space-borne
detectors such as LISA if the sources are close enough, and will be eventually
detected by ground-based detectors when the two neutron stars coalesce.

in which secondary tasks were re-defined by grouping similar tasks was
performed to investigate the extent to which ORs are affected by the specific
task definitions in SHRP2. A novel visual representation of multitasking was
developed to show which secondary tasks co-occur frequently and which ones do
not. MAD occurs in 11% of control driving segments, 22% of crashes and
near-crashes (CNC), 26% of Level 1-3 crashes and 39% of rear-end striking
crashes, and 9%, 16%, 17% and 28% respectively for the same event types if MAD
is defined in terms of general task groups. The most common co-occurrences of
secondary tasks vary substantially among event types; for example, 'Passenger
in adjacent seat - interaction' and 'Other non-specific internal eye glance'
tend to co-occur in CNC but tend not to co-occur in control driving segments.
The odds ratios of MAD compared to driving without any secondary task and the
corresponding 95% confidence intervals are 2.38 (2.17-2.61) for CNC, 3.72

confirm that independently of whether secondary tasks are defined according to
SHRP2 or general task groups, the reduction of driving performance from MAD
observed in simulator studies is manifested in real-world crashes as well.

of quantum optical experiments in the near-infrared and visible regions which
had been made possible by use of the nonlinear beta barium borate
ferroelectric, an analogue of YIG. It is illustrated here how the YIG
parametric amplifier can reproduce quantum optical Type I and Type II wave
interactions, which can be used to create entangled photons in the
millimeter-wave band. It is estimated that when half a cubic centimeter of YIG
crystal is placed in a magnetic field of a few Tesla and pumped with 5 Watts of
millimeter-wave radiation, approximately 0.5x10^12 entangled millimeter-wave
photon pairs per second are generated by the spin-wave interaction. This means
an integration time of only a few tens of seconds is needed for a successful
Bell Test. A successful demonstration of this will lead to novel architectures
of entanglement-based quantum technology room temperature sensors,
re-envisioning YIG as a modern quantum material.

quantum gate set $\left\{ {X,Z,H,P,R,CNOT} \right\}$ was firstly proposed by
Broadbent \emph{et al.}, and then Tan \emph{et al.} tried to put forward an
half-blind DQC protocol (HDQC) with another universal set $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T}

\emph{T}) is a little redundant, and Tan \emph{et al}.'s protocol exists the
information leak. In addition, both of these two protocols just focus on the
blindness of data (i.e., the client's input and output), but do not consider
the blindness of computation (i.e., the delegated quantum operation). For
solving these problems, we propose a full-blind DQC protocol (FDQC) with
quantum gate set $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T} \right\}$ , where the desirable
delegated quantum operation, one of $\left\{ {H,P,CNOT,T} \right\}$ , is
replaced by a fixed sequence $\left \{ {H,P,T,CZ,CNOT} \right\}$ to make the
computation blind, and the decryption circuit of \emph{Toffoli} gate is also
optimized. Analysis shows that our protocol can not only correctly perform any
delegated quantum computation, but also holds the characteristics of data
blindness and computation blindness.

by a time-dependent rank-1 saddle associated with one reaction and several
orthogonal coordinates (including the solvent bath). To investigate reactions
in such systems, we develop a fast and robust method ---viz., local manifold
analysis (LMA)--- for computing the instantaneous decay rate of reactants.
Specifically, it computes the instantaneous decay rates along saddle-bound
trajectories near the activated complex by exploiting local properties of the
stable and unstable manifold associated with the normally hyperbolic invariant
manifold (NHIM). The LMA method offers substantial reduction of numerical
effort and increased reliability in comparison to direct ensemble integration.
It provides an instantaneous flux that can be assigned to every point on the
NHIM and which is associated with a trajectory ---regardless of whether it is
periodic, quasi-periodic, or chaotic--- that is bound on the NHIM. The time
average of these fluxes in the driven system corresponds to the average rate
through a given local section containing the corresponding point on the NHIM.
We find good agreement between the results of the LMA and direct ensemble
integration obtained using numerically constructed, recrossing-free dividing
surfaces.

The method allows us to analyze the dynamics on the NHIM via Poincar\'e

introduces a graviton mass m into the theory, a result that will be derived
from the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli problem for a particle falling onto a
Kottler-Schwarzschild mass with Lambda. The value of m is precisely the Spin-2
gauge line appearing on the Lambda versus m2 phase diagram for Spin-2, the
partially massless gauge lines introduced by Deser & Waldron and described as
the Higuchi bound. Note that this graviton is unitary with only four
polarization degrees of freedom (helicities plus & minus 2 and 1, but not 0
because a scalar gauge symmetry removes it). The conclusion is drawn that
Einstein gravity (with Lambda) is a partially massless gravitation theory which
has lost its helicity 0 due to a scalar gauge symmetry. That poses a challenge
for gravitational wave antennas as to whether they can measure the loss of this
gauge symmetry. Also, given the recent results measuring the Hubble constant Ho
from LIGO-Virgo data, it is then shown that Lambda can be determined from the
LIGO results for the graviton mass m and Ho. This is yet another
multi-messenger source for determining the three parameters Lambda, m, and Ho
in astrophysics and cosmology, at a time when there is much disparity in
measurements of Ho.

protostars but their origin is not well understood. Going beyond studies of
individual objects, we want to investigate the origin of COMs in young

IRAM PdBI to search for COMs at high angular resolution in a sample of 26
solar-type protostars, including 22 Class 0 and four Class I objects. Methanol
is detected in 12 sources and tentatively in one source, which represents half
of the sample. Eight sources (30%) have detections of at least three COMs. We
find a strong chemical differentiation in multiple systems with five systems
having one component with at least three COMs detected but the other component
devoid of COM emission. The internal luminosity is found to be the source
parameter impacting the most the COM chemical composition of the sources, while
there is no obvious correlation between the detection of COM emission and that
of a disk-like structure. A canonical hot-corino origin may explain the COM
emission in four sources, an accretion-shock origin in two or possibly three
sources, and an outflow origin in three sources. The CALYPSO sources with COM
detections can be classified into three groups on the basis of the abundances
of oxygen-bearing molecules, cyanides, and CHO-bearing molecules. These
chemical groups correlate neither with the COM origin scenarii, nor with the
evolutionary status of the sources if we take the ratio of envelope mass to
internal luminosity as an evolutionary tracer. We find strong correlations
between molecules that are a priori not related chemically (for instance
methanol and methyl cyanide), implying that the existence of a correlation does
not imply a chemical link. [abridged]

and even on the polarimetric technique to be used (single-beam or dual-beam).
In this paper we evaluate the artificial line-of-sight velocities and magnetic
field strengths that arise in etalon-based instruments attending to the
mentioned factors. We differentiate between signals that are implicit to
telecentric mounts due to the wavelength dependence of the point-spread
function and those emerging in both collimated and telecentric setups from the
polarimetric response of birefringent etalons. For the anisotropic case we
consider two possible locations of the etalon, between the modulator and the
analyzer or after it, and we include the effect on different channels when
dual-beam polarimetry is employed. We also evaluate the impact of the loss of
symmetry produced in telecentric mounts due to imperfections in the
illumination and/or to a tilt of the etalon relative to the incident beam.

insufficient in explaining main ion heat and particle transport inside the

to mimic the impact of MHD activity on central transport. The ion to electron
temperature ratio at the simulation boundary at $\rho_\mathrm{tor} = 0.85$
stabilizes ion scale modes while destabilizing ETG modes when significantly
exceeding unity. Careful analysis of experimental measurements using Gaussian

bubbles. In this work, we want to further understand the bubble nucleation and
growth mechanism. In particular, we quantitatively study the effect of the
amount of dissolved air on the bubble nucleation and growth dynamics, both for
the initial giant bubble, which forms shortly after switching on the laser and
is mainly composed of vapor, and for the final life phase of the bubble, during
which it mainly contains air expelled from water. We found that the bubble
nucleation temperature depends on the gas concentration: the higher the gas
concentration, the lower the bubble nucleation temperature. Also, the long-term
diffusiondominated bubble growth is governed by the gas concentration. The
radius of the bubbles grows as R(t)~t^1/3 for airequilibrated and
air-oversaturated water. In contrast, in partially degassed water, the growth
is much slower since, even for the highest temperature we achieve, the water
remains undersaturated.

structured with microwells, when water flow passes along, and the subsequent
microbubble dissolution. At entrapment, the microbubble is initially pinned at
the edge of the microwell. At some point, the three-phase contact line detaches
from one side of the edge and separates from the wall, after which it further
recedes. We systematically investigate the evolution of the footprint diameter
and the contact angle of the entrapped microbubbles, which reveals that the
dissolution process is in the constant contact angle mode. By varying the gas
undersaturation level, we quantify how a high gas undersaturation enhances the
dissolution process, and compare with simplified theoretical predictions for
dissolving bubbles on a plane surface. We find that geometric partial blockage
effects of the diffusive flux out of the microbubble trapped in the microwell
lead to reduced dissolution rates.

rotation, dynamo, wind and magnetism. Multi-wavelength surveys of solar-like
stars have revealed the likely existence of relationships between their
rotation, X-ray luminosity, mass-losses and magnetism. Those impose strong
constraints on the corona and wind of cool stars.
  Aims. We aim to provide power-law prescriptions of the mass-loss of stars, of
their magnetic field, and of their base coronal density and temperature that
are compatible with their observationally-constrained spin-down.
  Methods. We link the magnetic field and the mass-loss rate from a wind torque
formulation in agreement with the distribution of stellar rotation periods in
open clusters and the Skumanich law. Given a wind model and an expression of
the X-ray luminosity from radiative losses, we constrain the coronal properties
by assuming different physical scenarii linking closed loops to coronal holes.
  Results. We find that the magnetic field and the mass loss are involved in a
one-to-one correspondence constrained from spin-down considerations. We show
that a magnetic field depending on both the Rossby number and the stellar mass
is required to keep a consistent spin-down model. The estimates of the magnetic
field and the mass-loss rate obtained from our formalism are consistent with
statistical studies as well as individual observations and give new leads to
constrain the magnetic field-rotation relation. The set of scaling-laws we
derived can be broadly applied to cool stars from the PMS to the end of the MS,
and allow for a stellar wind modelling consistent with all the observational
constraints available to date.

reporting even $\sim$1 dex weaker $L_{\rm X}$ compared to the prediction of the

relations followed by the bulk of the AGN population. We report in our
WISE/SDSS-selected Hyperluminous (WISSH) $z=2-4$ broad-line quasar sample, the
discovery of a dependence between the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity ($L_{\rm
2-10}$) and the blueshifted velocity of the CIV emission line ($v_{\rm CIV}$)
indicative of accretion disc winds. In particular, sources with fastest winds
($v_{\rm CIV}\gtrsim 3000~\rm km s^{-1}$) possess $\sim$0.5-1 dex lower $L_{\rm
2-10}$ than sources with negligible $v_{\rm CIV}$. No similar dependence is
found on $L_{\rm UV}$, $L_{\rm MIR}$, $L_{\rm bol}$, photon index and
absorption column density. We interpret these findings in the context of
accretion disc wind models. Both magnetohydrodynamic and line-driven models can
qualitatively explain the reported relations as a consequence of X-ray
shielding from the inner wind regions. In case of line-driven winds, the launch
of fast winds is favoured by a reduced X-ray emission, and we speculate that
these winds may play a role in directly limiting the coronal hard X-ray
production.

Increasing the problem size results in a vast amount of time consuming in
conventionally available computers. Photons possess the unique features of
extremely high propagation speed, weak interaction with environment and low
detectable energy level, therefore can be a promising candidate to meet the
challenge by constructing an a photonic computer computer. However, most of
optical computing schemes, like Fourier transformation, require very high
operation precision and are hard to scale up. Here, we present a chip built-in
photonic computer to efficiently solve the subset sum problem. We successfully
map the problem into a waveguide network in three dimensions by using
femtosecond laser direct writing technique. We show that the photons are able
to sufficiently dissipate into the networks and search all the possible paths
for solutions in parallel. In the case of successive primes the proposed
approach exhibits a dominant superiority in time consumption even compared with
supercomputers. Our results confirm the ability of light to realize a
complicated computational function that is intractable with conventional
computers, and suggest the subset sum problem as a good benchmarking platform
for the race between photonic and conventional computers on the way towards

exhibit a transition, taking place at the end of 2012, from an X-ray active
state to a radio pulsar state. The X-ray emission based on archival XMM-Newton
observations is highly variable, showing rapid variations (10 s) from a high
X-ray luminosity mode to a low mode and back. A flaring mode has also been
observed. X-ray pulsations have been detected during the high mode only. In
this work we present two possible interpretations for the rapid swings between
the high and low modes. In the first scenario, this phenomenon can be explained
by a rapid oscillation between a propeller state and a radio-ejection pulsar
state, during which the pulsar wind prevents matter from falling onto the
neutron star surface. In the second scenario, a radio pulsar is always active,
the intra-binary shock is located just outside the light cylinder in the high
mode, while it expands during the low mode. At variance with other transitional
pulsars, J12270 shows two instances of the low mode: a low-soft and low-hard
mode. Performing an X-ray spectral analysis, we show that the harder component,
present in the low-hard spectra, is probably related to the tail of the flare
emission. This supports the understanding that the flare mechanism is
independent of the high-to-low mode transitions.

work focuses on the details of the onset of the carbon detonation in the double

core-shell mixing on the carbon ignition mechanism, the helium shell and its
detonation are followed with an increased resolution compared to the rest of
the star treating the propagation of the detonation wave more accurately. This
significantly improves the predictions of the nucleosynthetic yields from the
helium burning. The simulations were carried out with the AREPO code. A
carbon-oxygen core with a helium shell was set up in one dimension and mapped
to three dimensions. We ensured the stability of the white dwarf with a
relaxation step before the hydrodynamic detonation simulation started.
Synthetic observables were calculated with the radiative transfer code ARTIS.
An ignition mechanism of the carbon detonation was observed, which received
little attention before. In this ""scissors mechanism"", the impact the helium
detonation wave has on unburnt material when converging opposite to its
ignition spot is strong enough to ignite a carbon detonation. This is possible
in a carbon enriched transition region between the core and shell. The
detonation mechanism is found to be sensitive to details of the core-shell
transition and our models illustrate the need to consider core-shell mixing
taking place during the accretion process. Even though the detonation ignition
mechanism differs form the converging shock mechanism, the differences in the
synthetic observables are not significant. Though they do not fit observations
better than previous simulations, they illustrate the need for
multi-dimensional simulations.

way for testing what is known as the ""no-hair"" theorem, stating that isolated
black holes are described by the Kerr metric, parameterized only by their mass
and spin. Generic, parameterized spacetimes beyond Kerr allow one to
arbitrarily test the no-hair theorem for deviations from the Kerr result with
no prior theoretical knowledge or motivation. In this paper, we present such a
new general, stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat black hole
solution with separable geodesic equations (thus preserving symmetries of a
Kerr black hole), extending the previous work of Johannsen. In this new metric,
five free non-linear functions parameterically deviate from the Kerr result,
allowing one to effectively transform to many alternative black hole solutions

orbits. We also compute the image of the photon rings in the new spacetime,

against various parameterizations of the metric, finding that, especially for
highly rotating black holes, the two solutions disagree significantly. Such a

framework to determine a minimal complete set of conserved quantities which
describes the long-time steady state has not yet been found. This paper shows
that the GGE of the gapless XXZ model consists of functionally independent
conserved quantities rather than linearly independent. At the same time, the
physical meaning of SFNI conserved quantities is provided. We also discuss that
there exist ballistic channels of the spin current supported by non-quasilocal
conserved quantities. The saturation of the lower bound for the Drude weight by
quasilocal conserved quantities reads the linear dependence of non-quasilocal
conserved quantities on quasilocal ones. We show that their (generalized)
linearly dependence relation is consistent with the statement that the GGE
consists of functionally independent conserved quantities without containing
all linearly independent conserved quantities.

Following a quasi model-independent approach for the 3PACF, we find the BAO
transversal signature for triangles with sides $\theta_1 = 1.0^\circ$ and
$\theta_2 = 1.5^\circ$ and the angle between them of $\alpha = 1.59 \pm 0.17$

recent work (${\theta}_{BAO} = 1.77^\circ \pm 0.31^\circ$ ) applying the 2PACF
to similar data. Moreover, we performed two type of tests: one to confirm the
robustness of the BAO signal in the 3PACF through random displacements in the
dataset, and the other to verify the suitability of our random samples, a null
test that in fact does not show any signature that could bias our results.

to light various difficulties, such as reconciling Lorentz symmetry with the

We present here a full solution avoiding those problems. The complete set of
Fock states is obtained, together with the corresponding explicit wavefunction
and their inner product integrals free from any divergence problem and the
Lorentz symmetry fully maintained without additional constraints imposed. By a
simple choice of the pseudo-unitary representation of the underlying symmetry
group, motivated from the perspective of the Minkowski spacetime as a
representation for the Lorentz group, we obtain the natural non-unitary Fock
space picture commonly considered though not formulated and presented in the
careful details given here. From a direct derivation of the appropriate basis
state wavefunctions of the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of
the Lorentz symmetry, the relation between the latter and the Fock state
wavefunctions is also explicitly shown. Moreover, the full picture including
the states with non-positive norm may give consistent physics picture as a
version of Lorentz covariant quantum mechanics. Probability interpretation for
the usual von Neumann measurements is not a problem as all wavefunctions
restricted to a definite value for the `time' variable are just like those of
the usual time independent quantum mechanics. A further understanding from a
perspective of the dynamics from the symplectic geometry of the phase space is
shortly discussed.

black hole (KSBH) characterized by a string parameter $\xi$. Kerr black hole is
recovered at $\xi=0$. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of
$\xi$ on a new diagnostic of relative time delay (RTD) to see how the latter
deviates from that in general relativity. Assuming KSBH as the spinning lens
partner in PSR-BH binary systems, which provide the best laboratory for testing
the time delay predictions, we study here the RTD up to third PPN order in
$\left(1/r\right)$ in the thin-lens approximation. We work out a useful
generalization of the RTD formulas applicable to the experimentally viable
\textit{finite} distance lens scales, while\ terms higher than the zeroth order
are shown to contain the effect of $\xi$. We shall also relate RTD to the
observable image magnification factor determined by $\beta/\theta_{E}$, where
$\beta$ is the angular separation between the source and the observer and
$\theta_{E}$ is the ""Einstein angle"" determined by an ""effective"" non-aligned
static lens equivalent to the original aligned spinning lens. Numerical
estimates for two typical binary lens systems show $\mu$sec level delay at the
zeroth order consistent with predictions in the literature. However, the string
effect at higher orders is too tiny to be measurable even in the far future
leading to the conclusion that the stringy and general relativity BHs are yet
observationally indistinguishable.

one can reveal and understand the Jovian magnetospheric dynamics and its
interaction with the moons. DAMs are generated by energetic electrons through
cyclotron-maser instability. For Io (the most active moon) related DAMs, the
energetic electrons are sourced from Io volcanic activities, and quickly
trapped by neighboring Jovian magnetic field. To properly interpret the
physical processes behind DAMs, it is important to precisely locate the source
field lines from which DAMs are emitted. Following the work by Hess et al.
[2008, 2010], we develop a method to locate the source region as well as the
associated field lines for any given DAM emission recorded in a radio dynamic
spectrum by, e.g., Wind/WAVES or STEREO/WAVES. The field lines are calculated
by the state-of-art analytical model, called JRM09 [Connerney et al., 2018]. By
using this method, we may also derive the emission cone angle and the energy of
associated electrons. If multiple radio instruments at different perspectives
saw the same DAM event, the evolution of its source region and associated field
lines is able to be revealed. We apply the method to an Io-DAM event, and find
that the method is valid and reliable. Some physical processes behind the DAM
event are also discussed.

identified in Helioseimsic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI) maps of flows near the solar surface. So far this has not been
done with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) ground-based
observations, which have different noise properties.
  Aims: We utilize 17 years of GONG++ data, to identify and characterize solar
Rossby waves using ring-diagram helioseismology. We compare directly with HMI
ring-diagram analysis.
  Methods: Maps of the radial vorticity are obtained for flows within the top 2
Mm of the surface for 17 years of GONG++. The data is corrected for systematic
effects including the annual periodicity related to the $B_0$ angle. We then
compute the Fourier components of the radial vorticity of the flows in the
co-rotating frame. We perform the same analysis on the HMI data that overlap in
time.
  Results: We find that the solar Rossby waves have measurable amplitudes in
the GONG++ sectoral power spectra for azimuthal orders between $m=3$ and
$m=15$. The measured mode characteristics (frequencies, lifetimes and
amplitudes) from GONG++ are consistent with the HMI measurements in the overlap
period from 2010 to 2018 for $m\le9$. For higher-$m$ modes the amplitudes and
frequencies agree within two sigmas. The signal-to-noise ratio of modes in
GONG++ power spectra is comparable to HMI for $8\le m\le11$, but is lower by a
factor of two for other modes.
  Conclusions: The GONG++ data provide a long and uniform data set to study
solar global-scale Rossby waves from 2001.

An interesting question is how much work an external agent has done on a

reminiscent of the second law of thermodynamics, for the work exerted by an

two O7.5 III-II(f) stars, is the most emblematic eclipsing O-star binary in the
very young and rich open cluster NGC6231. Its properties render the system an
interesting target for studying tidally induced apsidal motion. Measuring the
rate of apsidal motion in such a binary system gives insight into the internal
structure and evolutionary state of the stars composing it. A large set of
optical spectra was used to reconstruct the spectra of the individual binary
components and establish their radial velocities using a disentangling code.
Radial velocities measured over seven decades were used to establish the rate
of apsidal motion. We furthermore analysed the reconstructed spectra with the
CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar and wind properties of the
system. Optical photometry was analysed with the Nightfall binary star code. A
complete photometric and radial velocity model was constructed in PHOEBE 2 to
determine robust uncertainties. We find a rate of apsidal motion of
$(1.843^{+0.064}_{-0.083})\deg$ yr$^{-1}$. The photometric data indicate an
orbital inclination of $(67.6^{+0.2}_{-0.1})\deg$ and Roche-lobe filling
factors of both stars of about 0.86. Absolute masses of
$29.5^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$M$_\odot$ and mean stellar radii of
$15.07^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$R$_\odot$ are derived for both stars. We infer an
observational value for the internal structure constant of both stars of
$0.0010\pm0.0001$. Our in-depth analysis of the massive binary HD152248 and the
redetermination of its fundamental parameters can serve as a basis for the

Moreover, if by changing the couplings of the theory, the system undergoes
quantum phase transitions in which the gap closes, the complex structure $\tau$

explain the transition of highly energetic neutrinos propagating in matter to
tachyonic states. In this work, we determine the possible mechanisms that lead
neutrinos into a superluminal realm based on the assumption that
ultrarelativistic neutrinos travelling in matter lose part of their energy with
the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation. The obtained photons, in turn, can
create neutrino antineutrino pairs, one or both of which can be superluminal.
We also prove that pair creation may occur with neutrino flavour oscillation
provided that only one of them is a space-like particle. This suggests that
mass oscillation and superluminal behaviour could be related phenomena.
Finally, using the generalised Lorentz transformations, we formulate the
Lagrangian of the kinematically allowed scattering processes. The structure of
this Lagrangian is consistent with the formalism of the Standard Model. Based
on this Lagrangian, at least one of the particles forming the pair must always
be subluminal. The possibility that the pair creation process is mediated by a
dark photon is also discussed.

2002.01346v2,2020-02-04,2020-02-04,Physical and chemical modeling of the starless core L1512,"  The deuterium fractionation in starless cores gives us a clue to estimate
their lifetime scales, thus allowing us to distinguish between different
dynamical theories of core formation. Cores also seem to be subject to a
differential N2 and CO depletion which was not expected from models. We aim to
make a survey of 10 cores to estimate their lifetime scales and depletion
profiles in detail. After L183, in Serpens, we present the second cloud of the
series, L1512 in Auriga. To constrain the lifetime scale, we perform chemical
modeling of the deuteration profiles across L1512 based on dust extinction
measurements from near-infrared observations and non-local thermal equilibrium
radiative transfer with multiple line observations of N2H+, N2D+, DCO+, C18O,
and 13CO, plus H2D+ (1$_{10}$--1$_{11}$). We find a peak density of
1.1$\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ and a central temperature of 7.5$\pm$1 K, which are
respectively higher and lower compared with previous dust emission studies. The
depletion factors of N2H+ and N2D+ are 27$^{+17}_{-13}$ and 4$^{+2}_{-1}$ in
L1512, intermediate between the two other more advanced and denser starless
core cases, L183 and L1544. These factors also indicate a similar freeze-out of
N2 in L1512, compared to the two others despite a peak density one to two
orders of magnitude lower. Retrieving CO and N2 abundance profiles with the
chemical model, we find that CO has a depletion factor of $\sim$430-870 and the
N2 profile is similar to that of CO unlike towards L183. Therefore, L1512 has
probably been living long enough so that N2 chemistry has reached steady state.
N2H+ modeling remains compulsory to assess the precise physical conditions in
the center of cold starless cores, rather than dust emission. L1512 is
presumably older than 1.4 Myr. Therefore, the dominating core formation
mechanism should be ambipolar diffusion for this source.

context of photonic crystal cavities and superconducting resonators. To mimic
experimental imperfections, disorder in both the coupling strengths and
resonance frequencies is considered.

2002.01451v2,2020-02-04,2020-02-04,Chiral pasta,"  Interiors of neutron stars are ultra-dense and may contain a core of
deconfined quark matter. Such a core connects to the outer layers smoothly or
through a sharp microscopic interface or through an intermediate macroscopic
layer of inhomogeneous mixed phases, which is globally neutral but locally
contains electrically charged domains. Here I employ a nucleon-meson model
under neutron star conditions that shows a first-order chiral phase transition
at large densities. In the vicinity of this chiral transition I calculate the
free energies of various mixed phases - different 'pasta structures' - in the
Wigner-Seitz approximation. Crucially, chirally broken nuclear matter and the
approximately chirally symmetric phase (loosely interpreted as quark matter)
are treated on the same footing. This allows me to compute the interface
profiles of bubbles, rods, and slabs fully consistently, taking into account
electromagnetic screening effects and without needing the surface tension as an
input. I find that the full numerical results tend to disfavor mixed phases
compared to a simple step-like approximation used frequently in the literature
and that the predominantly favored pasta structure consists of slabs with a
surface tension $\Sigma \simeq 6\, {\rm MeV}/{\rm fm}^2$.

system which has a broad superconducting state with pair-density wave (PDW)

symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state, and the gapped spin sector of the
model supports Majorana zero modes. In this work, we reexamine this problem
using a combination of numeric and analytic methods. In extensive density
matrix renormalization group calculations, we find no evidence of a topological
ground state degeneracy or the previously proposed Majorana zero modes in the
PDW phase of this model. This result motivated us to reexamine the original
arguments for the existence of the Majorana zero modes. A careful analysis of
the effective continuum field theory of the model shows that the Hilbert space
of the spin sector of the theory does not contain any single Majorana fermion
excitations. This analysis shows that the PDW state of the doped 1D
Kondo-Heisenberg model is not an SPT with Majorana zero modes.

argue how differences in spatial order as the packing increases leads to

Although formally exact, its original target was the derivation of
Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics for slowly varying states in space and time. The
objective here is to revisit that work for the present interest in complex
quantum states - possible strong degeneracy, strong coupling, and all

highly regular with respect to free standing fibers, 2) they offer a monolithic
package with multi-fiber capabilities and 3) they operate at the diffraction
limit. These properties have enabled the realization of single component
photonic lanterns, highly simplified fiber Bragg gratings, and advanced fiber

  and Structural Conditions","  Automatic music generation is an interdisciplinary research topic that
combines computational creativity and semantic analysis of music to create
automatic machine improvisations. An important property of such a system is
allowing the user to specify conditions and desired properties of the generated
music. In this paper we designed a model for composing melodies given a user
specified symbolic scenario combined with a previous music context. We add
manual labeled vectors denoting external music quality in terms of chord
function that provides a low dimensional representation of the harmonic tension
and resolution. Our model is capable of generating long melodies by regarding
8-beat note sequences as basic units, and shares consistent rhythm pattern
structure with another specific song. The model contains two stages and
requires separate training where the first stage adopts a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (C-VAE) to build a bijection between note sequences and
their latent representations, and the second stage adopts long short-term
memory networks (LSTM) with structural conditions to continue writing future
melodies. We further exploit the disentanglement technique via C-VAE to allow
melody generation based on pitch contour information separately from
conditioning on rhythm patterns. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model using
quantitative analysis of rhythm and the subjective listening study. Results
show that the music generated by our model tends to have salient repetition
structures, rich motives, and stable rhythm patterns. The ability to generate
longer and more structural phrases from disentangled representations combined

massive charged scalar field in a linear perturbation regime. We study
tachyonic instabilities as the near horizon scalar condensation in a model of
$F(R)$ gravity with planar horizon and investigate properties of possible phase
transitions. The results show that such transitions are sensitive to the first
derivative of $F(R)$ with respect to $R$ in that the larger its value, the
higher the critical temperature, thus resulting in a new generation of
high-temperature superconductors. Also, for a certain range of parameters,
$F(R)$-charged $AdS_{4}$ black holes suffer from superradiant instability. We
consider the effects of the scalar mass and charge on such instabilities and
conclude that RN black holes decay into small hairy black holes that have a
charged scalar condensate floating near the horizon. It is shown that the
existence of phase transition at the critical temperature leading to a hairy
black hole solution emerges for $T<T_{c}$, while RN black holes exist for
$T>T_{c}$. The effect of $F(R)$ on the critical temperature is subsequently
investigated in the case of superradiant instability, showing that higher
critical temperatures would be possible in $F(R)$ gravity. We also check the
stability of hairy black holes and show that the resulting hairy solution can
be considered as a possible end point of superradiant instability of a small
charged black hole.

by the dominant $s$-wave pairing. Here we present a proposal for engineering
effective Hamiltonians with tunable mixed on- and off-site pairing based on

independently by means of a periodical driving field rather than magnetic
Feshbach resonances. It paves the way for suppressing the dominant on-site

synthesizing MZMs localized in edges or corners.

separation $\delta \nu$ in determining stellar ages, masses, and radii. We
adopted the SCEPtER pipeline for low-mass stars, [0.7, 1.05] Msun. Synthetic
stars were generated and reconstructed assuming different relative precision in
$\delta \nu$ (5% and 2%). The quantification of the systematic errors arising
from a mismatch between synthetic stars and the recovery grid was also
performed. The biases were negligible. The statistical error in age estimates
was strongly dependent on the stellar evolutionary phase. It is at its maximum
at ZAMS and decreases to about 11% and 6% ($\delta \nu$ at 5% and 2% level)
when stars reach the 30% of their evolutionary MS lifetime, then vanishes in
the last 20% of the MS. For mass and radius estimates we detected nearly
identical behavior for an observational uncertainty of 5%. No benefit was
detected for mass and radius determinations from a reduction $\delta \nu$
precision to 2%. The impact on the age of the initial helium abundance resulted
in negligible results. On the other hand greater bias (2% and 1%) in mass and
radius estimates were detected whenever $\delta \nu$ is in the observational
pool. This result, together with the presence of further unexplored uncertainty
sources, suggest that precision in the derived stellar quantities below these
thresholds may possibly be overoptimistic. [...] Finally, we compared the
estimates by the SCEPtER pipeline for 13 Kepler asteroseismic LEGACY sample

magnetic field in various experimental situations. Here this problem is
analyzed analytically and numerically. A modified sine-Gordon type equation in
the presence of time-dependent local field is derived and solved numerically in
static and dynamic cases. Two specific examples of local fields are considered:
induced either by an Abrikosov vortex, or by a tip of a magnetic force
microscope (MFM). It is demonstrated that time-dependent local field can induce
a dynamic flux-flow state in the junction with shuttling, or unidirectional
ratchet-like Josephson vortex motion. This provides a mechanism of detection
and manipulation of Josephson vortices by an oscillating MFM tip. In a static
case local field leads to a distortion of the critical current versus magnetic
field, $I_c(H)$, modulation pattern. The distortion is sensitive to both the
shape and the amplitude of the local field. Therefore, the $I_c(H)$ pattern
carries information about the local field distribution within the junction.
This opens a possibility for employing a single Josephson junction as a
scanning probe sensor with spatial resolution not limited by its geometrical
size, thus obviating a known problem of a trade-off between field sensitivity
and spatial resolution of a sensor.

  Nucleation","  Solvent exchange (also called solvent shifting or Ouzo effect) is a generally
used bottom-up process to mass-produce nanoscale droplets. In this process, a
good solvent for some oil is displaced by a poor one, leading to oil
nanodroplet nucleation and subsequent growth. Here we perform this process on a
hydrophobic substrate so that sessile droplets so-called surface
nanodroplets-develop, following the work of Zhang et al. [Zhang, X.; Lu, Z.;
Tan, H.; Bao, L.; He, Y.; Sun, C.; Lohse, D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.

very well-controlled Hele-Shaw geometry with negligible gravitational effects,
injecting the poor solvent in the center of the Hele-Shaw cell, and
characterize the emerging nanodroplets as a function of radial distance and
flow rates. We find that the mean droplet volume per area <Vol>_area strongly
depends on the local Peclet number Pe and follows a universal scaling law
<Vol>_area~Pe^(3/4). Moreover, the probability distribution function of the
droplet volume strongly depends on the local Pe as well, regardless of the flow
rates and radial distance, giving strong support to the theoretical model of
the solvent exchange process developed in Zhang et al.'s work.

within a framework of the attractive Bose-Hubbard model. The initial

inducing a weak modulation of the tunnelling rate and show that a single atom
can be extracted while the remaining atoms stay localized despite the
persistent external modulation. This scheme suggests the experimental
realization of small matter-wave solitons with deterministic number of atoms.
In addition, the knowledge of exact eigenstates allows identification of the
selection rules for transitions between the different eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian. One selection rule is related to the translation symmetry of the
system. Another one is strictly applicable only on a subspace of the total
Hilbert space and is related to the parity symmetry. We show that in the
strongly interacting limit this selection rule has implications on the entire
Hilbert space. We discuss its signatures on the system's dynamics and consider
how it can be observed experimentally with ultracold atoms.

systems is evaluated in a wide parameter range, from the very weakly coupled
gaseous state to the strongly coupled fluid at the crystallization point (Yukwa
melt). This allows us to quantify how shear rigidity develops with increasing
coupling and inter-particle correlations. The radial distribution functions
(RDFs) needed to calculate the excess shear modulus have been obtained from
extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD results demonstrate that
fluid RDFs appear quasi-universal on the curves parallel to the melting line of
a Yukawa solid, in accordance with the isomorph theory of Roskilde-simple
systems. This quasi-universality, allows to simplify considerably calculations
of quantities involving integrals of the RDF (elastic moduli represent just one
relevant example). The calculated reduced shear modulus grows linearly with the
coupling parameter at weak coupling and approaches a quasi-constant asymptote
at strong coupling. The asymptotic value at strong coupling is in reasonably
good agreement with the existing theoretical approximation.

  method","  Modelling the solar Transition Region with the use of an Adaptive Conduction
(TRAC) method permits fast and accurate numerical solutions of the
field-aligned hydrodynamic equations, capturing the enthalpy exchange between
the corona and transition region, when the corona undergoes impulsive heating.
The TRAC method eliminates the need for highly resolved numerical grids in the
transition region and the commensurate very short time steps that are required
for numerical stability. When employed with coarse spatial resolutions,
typically achieved in multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic codes, the errors
at peak density are less than 5% and the computation time is three orders of
magnitude faster than fully resolved field-aligned models. This paper presents
further examples that demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the method
over a range of heating events, including impulsive and quasi-steady footpoint
heating. A detailed analytical assessment of the TRAC method is also presented,
showing that the approach works through all phases of an impulsive heating
event because (i) the total radiative losses and (ii) the total heating when
integrated over the transition region are both preserved at all temperatures
under the broadening modifications of the method. The results from the
numerical simulations complement this conclusion.

an intriguing behavior: they either grow or decay with increasing angular
harmonic numbers $\ell$, depending on whether the mass of the scalar field is
small or large. We identify the properties of the effective potential of the
scalar field that leads to this behavior and characterize it in detail. If the
scalar field is non-minimally coupled, considered here, the scalar quasinormal
modes will leak into the gravitational wave signal and will have decaying times
that are comparable or smaller than those typical in General Relativity. Hence,
these modes could be detectable in the future. Finally, we find that the
anomalous behavior in the decay timescales of quasinormal modes is present in a
much larger class of models beyond a simple massive scalar field.

2002.01898v1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,"Bistability in the Unstable Flow of Polymer Solutions Through Porous
  Media","  Polymer solutions are often injected in porous media for applications such as
oil recovery and groundwater remediation. As the fluid navigates the tortuous
pore space, elastic stresses build up, causing the flow to become unstable at
sufficiently large injection rates. However, it is poorly understood how the
spatial and temporal characteristics of this unstable flow depend on pore space
geometry. We elucidate this dependence by systematically varying the spacing
between pore constrictions in a model porous medium. We find that when the pore
spacing is large, unstable eddies form upstream of each pore, similar to
observations of an isolated pore. By contrast, when the pore spacing is
sufficiently small, the flow exhibits a surprising bistability, stochastically
switching between two distinct unstable flow states. We hypothesize that this
unusual behavior arises from the interplay between flow-induced polymer
elongation and relaxation of polymers as they are advected through the porous
medium. Consistent with this idea, we find that the flow state in a given pore
persists for long times. Moreover, we find that the flow state is correlated
between neighboring pores; however, these correlations do not persist
long-range. Our results thus help to elucidate the rich array of flow behaviors
that can arise in polymer solution flow through porous media.

$\varepsilon$-iron under pressure from 12 to 33 GPa by using a combination of
density functional and dynamical mean-field theory. Our results indicate a
persistence of the Fermi-liquid behavior below the temperature $\sim$1000 K.
The Coulomb correlations are found to substantially renormalize the density of
states, reducing the distance from the peak to the Fermi level to 0.4 eV
compared to 0.75 eV obtained in DFT calculations. We find significant
antiferromagnetic correlations, which are accompanied by the formation of
short-lived local magnetic moments. We use the obtained results as a starting
point for construction of the multi-band Bethe-Salpeter equation, which
eigenvalues indicate that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations may result in the
superconducting pairing in $\varepsilon$-Fe. Moreover, the tendency to
superconducting instability becomes weaker with the increase of pressure, which
may explain the disappearance of superconductivity at $\sim$30 GPa.

180916.J0158+65 and 160 days in FRB 121102) are consistent with that of tight,
stellar mass binary systems. In the case of FRB 180916.J0158+65 the primary is
an early OB-type star with mass loss rate $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}- 10^{-7}

is not intrinsic to the FRB's source, but is due to the orbital phase-dependent
modulation of the absorption conditions in the massive star's wind. The
observed relatively narrow FRB activity window implies that the primary's wind
dynamically dominates that of the pulsar, $\eta = L_{sd}/(\dot{M} v_w c) \leq
1$, where $L_{sd} $ is pulsar spin-down, $\dot{M}$ is the primary's wind mass
loss rate and $v_w$ is its velocity. The condition $\eta \leq 1$ requires
mildly powerful pulsar with $L_{sd} \lesssim 10^{37}$ erg $s^{-1}$. The
observations are consistent with magnetically-powered radio emission

2002.01945v1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,Evolution of the grain size distribution in galactic discs,"  Dust is formed out of stellar material and is constantly affected by
different mechanisms occurring in the ISM. Dust grains behave differently under
these mechanisms depending on their sizes, and therefore the dust grain size
distribution also evolves as part of the dust evolution itself. Following how
the grain size distribution evolves is a difficult computing task that is just
recently being overtaking. Smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations of
a single galaxy as well as cosmological simulations are producing the first
predictions of the evolution of the dust grain size distribution. We compare
for the first time the evolution of the dust grain size distribution predicted
by the SPH simulations with the results provided by the observations. We
analyse how the radial distribution of the small to large grain mass ratio
(D(S)/D(L)) changes over the whole discs in three galaxies: M 101, NGC 628 and
M 33. We find good agreement between the observed radial distribution of
D(S)/D(L) and what is obtained from the SPH simulations of a single galaxy. The
central parts of NGC 628, at high metallicity and with a high molecular gas
fraction, are mainly affected not only by accretion but also by coagulation of
dust grains. The centre of M 33, having lower metallicity and lower molecular
gas fraction, presents an increase of D(S)/D(L), showing that shattering is
very effective in creating a large fraction of small grains. Observational
results provided by our galaxies confirm the general relations predicted by the
cosmological simulations based on the two grain size approximation. However, we
present evidence that the simulations could be overestimating the amount of
large grains in high massive galaxies.

modulating the resonant frequencies of the qubits connected with each other via
capacitors, we can dynamically turn on and off qubit-qubit couplings, and
further create chiral flows of the excitations in the three-qubit circular

the degree of freedom in quantum simulation tasks.

experimental trends are also supported by a basic model and device simulation.

2002.01970v1,2020-02-05,2020-02-05,Reply to: Overconfidence in Bayesian analyses of galaxy rotation curves,"  Cameron {\it et al.}~2019 (hereafter C19) recommends a more cautious and
rigorous approach to statistical analysis in astronomy. We welcome this
particular side of their communication as it helps stimulating the effort
towards the adoption of better statistical methods in galaxy rotation curves,
an effort to which we contributed with Rodrigues {\it et al.}~2018 (hereafter
R18). Indeed, R18 was the first work that, in order to conclude on the
universality of the acceleration scale $a_0$, studied the posterior
distributions on $a_0$ of a large set of galaxies. As C19 agrees, the credible
intervals were found within the Bayesian framework, that is, the marginalized
posteriors on $a_0$ were found using Bayes' theorem to update the priors in
light of the observational data; this process was done without introducing any
approximation. Considering R18, C19 also remarks that: i) better methods to
select the nuisance parameters and the corresponding priors could be used; ii)
a quality cut based on $\chi^2$ values should not be used, and iii) the
compatibility of the posteriors should be assessed in a more robust way. In the
following, after first clarifying the context of our work, we address these
criticisms.

expansions, taking care to resolve all of the singular surfaces (light
surfaces) in the problem. Working with the monopole field configuration, we
show explicitly how the inconsistencies are resolved in this framework and
calculate the field configuration to one order higher than previously known.
However, there is no correction to the energy extraction rate at this order.

  system","  Transit Timing Variations, or TTVs, can be a very efficient way of
constraining masses and eccentricities of multi-planet systems. Recent
measurements of the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1 led to an estimate of the masses of the
planets, enabling an estimate of their densities. A recent TTV analysis using
data obtained in the past two years yields a 34% and 13% increase in mass for
TRAPPIST-1b and c, respectively. In most studies to date, a Newtonian N-body
model is used to fit the masses of the planets, while sometimes general
relativity is accounted for. Using the Posidonius N-body code, we show that in
the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, non-Newtonian effects might be also relevant
to correctly model the dynamics of the system and the resulting TTVs. In
particular, using standard values of the tidal Love number $k_2$ (accounting
for the tidal deformation) and the fluid Love number $k_{2f}$ (accounting for
the rotational flattening) leads to differences in the TTVs of TRAPPIST-1b and
c similar to the differences caused by general relativity. We also show that
relaxing the values of tidal Love number $k_2$ and the fluid Love number
$k_{2f}$ can lead to TTVs which differ by as much as a few 10~s on a $3-4$-year
timescale, which is a potentially observable level. The high values of the Love
numbers needed to reach observable levels for the TTVs could be achieved for
planets with a liquid ocean, which, if detected, might then be interpreted as a
sign that TRAPPIST-1b and TRAPPIST-1c could have a liquid magma ocean. For
TRAPPIST-1 and similar systems, the models to fit the TTVs should potentially
account for general relativity, for the tidal deformation of the planets, for
the rotational deformation of the planets and, to a lesser extent, for the
rotational deformation of the star, which would add up to 7x2+1 = 15 additional
free parameters in the case of TRAPPIST-1.

UV continua at $5.7\le z \le 6.6$. These LAEs have previous HST and Spitzer
IRAC observations. Combining our newly acquired HST images, we find that their
UV-continuum slopes $\beta$ are in a range of $-3.4\le \beta \le -2.6$. Unlike
previous, tentative detections of $\beta \simeq -3$ in photometrically
selected, low-luminosity galaxies, our LAEs are spectroscopically confirmed and
luminous ($M_{\rm UV}<-20$ mag). We model their broadband spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), and find that two $\beta\simeq-2.6\pm0.2$ galaxies can be
well fitted with young and dust-free stellar populations. However, it becomes
increasingly difficult to fit bluer galaxies. We explore further
interpretations by including non-zero LyC escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}$, very
low metallicities, and/or AGN contributions. Assuming $f_{\rm esc}\simeq0.2$,
we achieve the bluest slopes $\beta\simeq-2.7$ when nebular emission is
considered. This can nearly explain the SEDs of two galaxies with
$\beta\simeq-2.8$ and --2.9 ($\sigma_{\beta}=0.15$). Larger $f_{\rm esc}$
values and very low metallicities are not favored by the strong nebular line
emission (evidenced by the IRAC flux) or the observed (IRAC 1 - IRAC 2) color.
Finally, we find that the $\beta\simeq-2.9$ galaxy can potentially be well
explained by the combination of a very young population with a high $f_{\rm
esc}$ ($\ge0.5$) and an old, dusty population. We are not able to produce two
$\beta \simeq -3.4 \pm0.4$ galaxies. Future deep spectroscopic observations are
needed to fully understand these galaxies.

emerge from perturbations, and the perturbation phase is normally unknown.
However, if the perturbation phase is known or actively imposed by, for
example, a designed driver wobbling behavior, the instability growth would be
controlled and mitigated by a superimposition of the perturbations imposed. The
results in this paper demonstrate that the wobbling z-current electron beam

large scale rotation, through the conservation of angular momentum during the
collapse of a prestellar dense core. We investigate the possibility for a
protostellar disk to be formed from a motionless dense core which contains
non-axisymmetric density fluctuations. The rotation is thus generated locally
by the asymmetry of the collapse. We study the evolution of the angular
momentum in a non-axisymmetric collapse of a dense core from an analytical
point of view. To test the theory, we perform three-dimensional simulations of
a collapsing prestellar dense core using adaptative mesh refinement. We start
from a non-axisymmetrical situation, considering a dense core with random
density perturbations that follow a turbulence spectrum. We analyse the
emerging disk comparing the angular momentum it contains with the one expected
from our analytic development. We study the velocity gradients at different
scales in the simulation as it is done with observations. We show that the
angular momentum in the frame of a stellar object which is not located at the
center of mass of the core is not conserved, due to inertial forces. Our
simulations of such non-axisymmetrical collapse quickly produce accretion disks
at the small scales in the core. The analysis of the kinematics at different
scales in the simulated core reveals projected velocity gradients of amplitudes
similar to the ones observed in protostellar cores, and which directions vary,
sometimes even reversing when small and large scales are compared. These
complex kinematics patterns appear in recent observations, and could be a
discriminating feature with models where rotation is inherited from large

gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences, its high
computational cost has limited current searches to less sensitive
coincidence-based schemes. Following up on previous work that has demonstrated
the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational
cost of this search, we present an implementation that achieves near real-time
computational speed. This is achieved by combining the search efficiency of PSO
with a significantly revised and optimized numerical implementation of the
underlying mathematical formalism along with additional multi-threaded
parallelization layers in a distributed computing framework. For a network of
four second-generation detectors with $60$~min data from each, the runtime of
the implementation presented here ranges between $\approx 1.4$ to $\approx 0.5$
times the data duration for network signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of $\gtrsim
10$ and $\gtrsim 12$, respectively. The reduced runtimes are obtained with
small to negligible losses in detection sensitivity: for a false alarm rate of
$\simeq 1$~event per year in Gaussian stationary noise, the loss in detection
probability is $\leq 5\%$ and $\leq 2\%$ for SNRs of $10$ and $12$,
respectively. Using the fast implementation, we are able to quantify
frequentist errors in parameter estimation for signals in the double neutron
star mass range using a large number of simulated data realizations. A clear
dependence of parameter estimation errors and detection sensitivity on the
condition number of the network antenna pattern matrix is revealed. Combined
with previous work, this paper securely establishes the effectiveness of
PSO-based fully-coherent all-sky search across the entire binary inspiral mass
range that is relevant to ground-based detectors.

to the smaller nucleosynthetic variations for Pd reported here and the lack of
such variations for more volatile elements. The smaller magnitude variations
measured in heavier refractory elements suggest that material from
high-metallicity AGB stars dominated stardust in the Solar System. These stars
produce less heavy s-process elements compared to the bulk Solar System

that the damping-like spin-orbit torque decreases substantially for all samples
with a spacer layer compared to the reference Pt/Co bilayer, consistently with
the opposite sign of the atomic spin-orbit coupling constant of the spacer
elements relative to Pt. The reduction of the damping-like torque is monotonic
with atomic number for the isoelectronic 3d, 4d, and 5d elements, with the
exception of V that has a stronger effect than Cr. The field-like spin-orbit
torque almost vanishes for all spacer layers irrespective of their composition,
suggesting that this torque predominantly originates at the Pt/Co interface.
The anomalous Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and saturation magnetization are
also all reduced substantially, whereas the sheet resistance is increased in
the presence of the spacer layer. Finally, we evidence a correlation between
the amplitude of the spin-orbit torques, the spin Hall-like magnetoresistance,

optoelectronic and fluidic devices. Nevertheless, such hydrophobic thin films
rely only on graphene non-polar surface, rather than taking advantage of its
surface roughness. Furthermore, graphene is typically not self-standing.
Differently, carbon aerogels have high porosity, large effective surface area
due to their surface roughness, and very low mass density, which make them a
promising candidate as a super-hydrophobic material for novel technological
applications. However, despite a few works reporting the general
super-hydrophobic and lipophilic behavior of the carbon aerogels, a detailed
characterization of their wetting properties is still missing, to date. Here,
the wetting properties of graphene aerogels are demonstrated in detail. Without
any chemical functionalization or patterning of their surface, the samples
exhibit a super-lipophilic state and a stationary super-hydrophobic state with
a contact angle up to $150\pm15^{\deg}$ and low contact angle hysteresis
$\approx15^{\deg}$, owing to the fakir effect. In addition, the adhesion force
of the graphene aerogels in contact with the water droplets and their surface
tension are evaluated. For instance, the unique wettability and enhanced liquid
absorption of the graphene aerogels can be exploited for reducing contamination
from oil spills and chemical leakage accidents.

  solution: implications for calcium sulfates on Mars","  CaSO4 minerals (i.e. gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite) are widespread in
natural and industrial environments. During the last several years, a number of
studies have revealed that nucleation in the CaSO4-H2O system is non-classical,
where the formation of crystalline phases involves several steps. Based on
these recent insights we have formulated a tentative general model for calcium
sulfate precipitation from solution. This model involves primary species that
are formed through the assembly of multiple Ca2+ and SO42- ions into
nanoclusters. These nanoclusters assemble into poorly ordered (i.e. amorphous)
hydrated aggregates, which in turn undergo ordering into coherent crystalline
units. The thermodynamic (meta)stability of any of the three CaSO4 phases is
regulated by temperature, pressure and ionic strength with gypsum being the
stable form at low temperatures and low to medium ionic strengths, and
anhydrite the stable phase at high temperatures and lower temperature at high
salinities. Bassanite is metastable across the entire phase diagram but readily
forms as the primary phase at high ionic strengths across a wide range of
temperatures, and can persist up to several months. Although the
physicochemical conditions leading to bassanite formation in aqueous systems
are relatively well established, nanoscale insights into the nucleation
mechanisms and pathways are still lacking. To fill this gap, and to further
improve our general model for calcium sulfate precipitation, we have conducted
in situ scattering measurements at small- and wide-angles (SAXS/WAXS) and
complemented these with in situ Raman spectroscopic characterization. Based on
these experiments we show that the process of formation of bassanite from
aqueous solutions is very similar to the formation of gypsum: it involves the
aggregation of small primary species into larger disordered aggregates.

transfer code. Four stars showed a large mid- or far-infrared excess and the
fitting then included a dust component. These comprise the well-known case of
RS Pup, and three stars that are (likely) Type-II cepheids (T2Cs), AU Peg, QQ
Per, and FQ Lac.
  The remainder of the sample was fitted with a stellar photosphere to derive
the best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature. Distance and reddening
were taken from the literature. The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram and compared to evolutionary tracks for cepheids and theoretical
instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is
consistent with the instability strip for a CC or T2C. About 5% of the stars
are outliers in the sense that they are much hotter or cooler than expected. A
comparison to effective temperatures derived from spectroscopy suggests in some
cases that the photometrically derived temperature is not correct and that this
is likely linked to an incorrectly adopted reddening.
  In this work the presence of a small NIR excess, as has been proposed in the
literature for a few well-known cepheids, is investigated. Firstly, this was
done by using a sample of about a dozen stars for which a mid-infrared spectrum
is available. Secondly, the SEDs of all stars were fitted with a dust model to
see if a statistically significant better fit could be obtained. The results
were compared to recent work. Eight new candidates for exhibiting a NIR excess
are proposed, solely based on the photometric SEDs. Obtaining mid-infrared
spectra would be needed to confirm this excess. Finally, period-bolometric

the binary SMBHs while alternative models attribute it to the geometrical
effect related to the precession of a single jet or double jets. We discuss
implications of the new spectral features reported during the 2015--2017
multi-wavelength high activity of the source -- a break in the NIR-optical
spectrum and hardening of the MeV-GeV emission accompanied by a shift in the
location of its peak, in the context of the two. The reported NIR-optical break
nicely fits the description of a standard accretion disk emission from an SMBH
of mass $\sim~10^{10}~M_\odot$ while the time of its first appearance in
end-May 2013 (MJD 56439) is in close coincidence with the time of impact
predicted by the disk-impact binary SMBH model. This spectral and temporal
coincidence with the model parameters of the disk-impact binary SMBH model
provides independent evidence in favor of the model over the geometrical models
which argue a total central-engine mass in the range of $\rm 10^{7-9}~M_\odot$.
On the other hand, the MeV-GeV spectral change is naturally reproduced by the
inverse Compton scattering of photons from the broad-line region and is
consistent with the detection of broad emission lines during the previous
cycles of quasi-periodic outbursts. Combining this with previous SED studies
suggests that in OJ 287, MeV-GeV emission results from external Comptonization.

  Evolutions","  A relevant problem in quantum computing concerns how fast a source state can
be driven into a target state according to Schr\""odinger's quantum mechanical

in detail the computational aspects necessary to calculate the transition
probability from a source state to a target state in a continuous time quantum
search problem defined by a multi-parameter generalized time-independent
Hamiltonian. In particular, quantifying the performance of a quantum search in
terms of speed (minimum search time) and fidelity (maximum success
probability), we consider a variety of special cases that emerge from the
generalized Hamiltonian. In the context of optimal quantum search, we find it
is possible to outperform, in terms of minimum search time, the well-known
Farhi-Gutmann analog quantum search algorithm. In the context of nearly optimal
quantum search, instead, we show it is possible to identify sub-optimal search
algorithms capable of outperforming optimal search algorithms if only a
sufficiently high success probability is sought. Finally, we briefly discuss
the relevance of a tradeoff between speed and fidelity with emphasis on issues
of both theoretical and practical importance to quantum information processing.

production rates in geodesic evolution on manifolds of parametrized quantum
states. These pure states emerge as outputs of suitable su(2; C) time-dependent

quantum system from an initial state to a final state on the manifold in a
finite temporal interval. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the minimizing
(optimum) path is the shortest (geodesic) path between the two states, and, in
particular, minimizes also the total entropy production that occurs during the
transfer. Finally, by evaluating the entropic speed and the total entropy
production along the optimum transfer paths in a number of physical scenarios
of interest in analog quantum search problems, we show in a clear quantitative
manner that to a faster transfer there corresponds necessarily a higher entropy
production rate. Thus, we conclude that lower entropic efficiency values appear

  Magnetographs by Multilayer Perceptron","  For filter-based magnetographs, the linear calibration method under the
weak-field assumption is usually adopted; this leads to magnetic saturation
effect in the regions with strong magnetic field. This article explores a new
method to overcome the above disadvantage using a multilayer perceptron
network, which we call MagMLP, based on a back-propagation algorithm with one
input layer, five hidden layers, and one output layer. We use the data from the
\textit{Spectropolarimeter} (SP) on board \textit{Hinode} to simulate
single-wavelength observations for the model training, and take into account
the influence of the Doppler velocity field and the filling factor. The
training results show that the linear fitting coefficient (LFC) of the
transverse field reaches above 0.91, and that of the longitudinal field is
above 0.98. The generalization of the models is good because the corresponding
LFCs are above 0.9 for the test subsets. Compared with the linear calibration
method, the MagMLP is much more effective on dealing with the magnetic
saturation effect. Analyzing an active region, the results of the linear
calibration present an evident magnetic saturation effect in the umbra regions;
the corresponding systematic error reaches values greater than 1000 G in most
areas, or even exceeds 2000 G at some pixels. However, the results of MagMLP at
these locations are very close to the inversion results, and the systematic
errors are basically within 300 G. In addition, we find that there are many
""bright spots"" and ""dark spots"" on the inclination angle images from the
inversion results of \textit{Hinode}/SP with values of 180 and 0 degrees,
respectively, where the inversion is not reliable and does not produce a good

energy harvesters for energy autonomous sensor systems. In Industry 4.0 (or
Industrial IoT) applications, interconnected sensors provide a means of data
acquisition for automated control of the manufacturing process. Ensuring a
continuous energy supply to the sensors is essential for their reliable
operation. Manufacturing machines usually display a wide spectrum of vibration
frequencies which needs to be covered by an array of harvester substructures in
order to maintain the desired output level. We show that mechanical structures
designed to implement a Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator have an increased
bandwidth by exploiting several orders of parametric resonances. In contrast to
concepts implementing parametric amplification in a multi-mode scenario, our
concept is based on a single mechanical mode. Therefore, it is more robust
against fabrication tolerances as the relevant multi-mode resonance conditions
do not need to be matched on the level of single chips. Using exact transient
simulations and semi-analytic models to showcase the relation of the
Helmholtz-Duffing oscillator to the damped and driven Mathieu equation, we show
that parametric resonances highly increase the bandwidth of the output power
whenever high Helmholtz nonlinearities are present. To achieve the required
nonlinearities, we suggest nonlinear stress-strain curves and we propose to
achieve such nonlinearities through field-induced striction by magneto- or
electrostriction. Thus, we are able to propose a novel energy harvester concept
incorporating strictive materials that exploits the effects of parametric
excitation to achieve broadband vibrational energy harvesting.

are pronounced, we carried out a linear stability analysis to obtain the growth

show that the interaction between the diamagnetic current and the radial

magnetorotational instability and generates a force perpendicular to the disc
plane which may induce a torque. It is also shown that considering the radial

magnitudes of the growth rates of both the axisymmetric ($m=0$) and the

  features","  A thorough understanding of the dynamics of meter-sized airgun-bubbles is
very crucial to seabed geophysical exploration. In this study, we use the
boundary integral method to investigate the highly non-spherical airgun-bubble
dynamics and its corresponding pressure wave emission. Moreover, a model is
proposed to also consider the process of air release from the airgun port,
which is found to be the most crucial factor to estimate the initial peak of
the pressure wave. The numerical simulations show good agreement with
experiments, in terms of non-spherical bubble shapes and pressure waves.
Thereafter, the effects of the port opening time $T\rm_{open}$, airgun firing
depth, heat transfer, and gravity are numerically investigated. We find that a
smaller $T\rm_{open}$ leads to a more violent air release that consequently
causes stronger high-frequency pressure wave emissions; however, the
low-frequency pressure waves are little affected. Additionally, the
non-spherical bubble dynamics is highly dependent on the Froude number $Fr$.
Starting from $Fr=2$, as $Fr$ increases, the jet contains lower kinetic energy,
resulting in a stronger energy focusing of the bubble collapse itself and thus
a larger pressure peak during the bubble collapse phase. For $Fr \ge 7$, the
spherical bubble theory becomes an appropriate description of the
airgun-bubble. The new findings of this study may provide a reference for
practical operations and designing environmentally friendly airguns in the near
future.

the SB1 rate to evaluate the GES SB1 binary fraction and its dependence with
effective temperature and metallicity. We find 641 (resp., 803) FGK SB1

distribution is estimated from the RV standard-deviation distribution and
reveals that the detected SB1 probe binaries with log(P[d]) < 4. We estimate
the global GES SB1 fraction to be in the range 7-14% with a typical uncertainty
of 4%. The GES SB1 frequency decreases with metallicity at a rate of
-9+/-3%/dex in the metallicity range -2.7<FeH<+0.6. This anticorrelation is
obtained with a confidence level higher than 93% on a homogeneous sample
covering spectral types FGK and a large range of metallicities. When the
present-day mass function is accounted for, this rate turns to 4+/-2%/dex with
a confidence level higher than 88%. In addition we provide the variation of the
SB1 fraction with metallicity separately for F, G, and K spectral types, as
well as for dwarf and giant primaries.

high-energy (HE; 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) {\gamma}-ray emitters. {\eta} Car is
the most prominent member of this object class and is confirmed to emit
phase-locked HE {\gamma} rays from hundreds of MeV to ~100 GeV energies. This
work aims to search for and characterise the very-high-energy (VHE; E >100 GeV)
{\gamma}-ray emission from {\eta} Car around the last periastron passage in
2014 with the ground-based High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). Methods.
The region around {\eta} Car was observed with H.E.S.S. between orbital phase p
= 0.78 - 1.10, with a closer sampling at p {\approx} 0.95 and p {\approx} 1.10
(assuming a period of 2023 days). Optimised hardware settings as well as
adjustments to the data reduction, reconstruction, and signal selection were
needed to suppress and take into account the strong, extended, and
inhomogeneous night sky background (NSB) in the {\eta} Car field of view.
Tailored run-wise Monte-Carlo simulations (RWS) were required to accurately
treat the additional noise from NSB photons in the instrument response
functions. Results. H.E.S.S. detected VHE {\gamma}-ray emission from the
direction of {\eta} Car shortly before and after the minimum in the X-ray
light-curve close to periastron. Using the point spread function provided by
RWS, the reconstructed signal is point-like and the spectrum is best described
by a power law. The overall flux and spectral index in VHE {\gamma} rays agree
within statistical and systematic errors before and after periastron. The
{\gamma}-ray spectrum extends up to at least ~400 GeV. This implies a maximum
magnetic field in a leptonic scenario in the emission region of 0.5 Gauss. No
indication for phase-locked flux variations is detected in the H.E.S.S. data.

affordable, and personalized therapeutic interventions for children with autism

still limited in their ability to autonomously recognize and respond to
behavioral cues, especially in atypical users and everyday settings. This work
applies supervised machine learning algorithms to model user engagement in the

Specifically, we present two types of engagement models for each user: (i)
generalized models trained on data from different users; and (ii)
individualized models trained on an early subset of the user's data. The models
achieved approximately 90% accuracy (AUROC) for post hoc binary classification
of engagement, despite the high variance in data observed across users,
sessions, and engagement states. Moreover, temporal patterns in model
predictions could be used to reliably initiate re-engagement actions at
appropriate times. These results validate the feasibility and challenges of
recognition and response to user disengagement in long-term, real-world HRI
settings. The contributions of this work also inform the design of engaging and

  Rb$_2$Mn$_3$(MoO$_4$)$_3$(OH)$_2$","  Macroscopic magnetic properties and microscopic magnetic structure of
Rb$_2$Mn$_3$(MoO$_4$)$_3$(OH)$_2$ (space group $Pnma$) are investigated by
magnetization, heat capacity and single-crystal neutron diffraction
measurements. The compound's crystal structure contains bond-alternating
[Mn$_3$O$_{11}$]$^{\infty}$ chains along the $b$-axis, formed by isosceles
triangles of Mn ions occupying two crystallographically nonequivalent sites
(Mn1 site on the base and Mn2 site on the vertex). These chains are only weakly
linked to each other by nonmagnetic oxyanions. Both SQUID magnetometry and
neutron diffraction experiments show two successive magnetic transitions as a
function of temperature. On cooling, it transitions from a paramagnetic phase
into an incommensurate phase below 4.5~K with a magnetic wavevector near ${\bf
k}_{1} = (0,~0.46,~0)$. An additional commensurate antiferromagnetically
ordered component arises with ${\bf k}_{2} = (0,~0,~0)$, forming a complex
magnetic structure below 3.5~K with two different propagation vectors of
different stars. On further cooling, the incommensurate wavevector undergoes a
lock-in transition below 2.3~K. The experimental results suggest that the
magnetic superspace group is $Pnma.1'(0b0)s0ss$ for the single-${\bf k}$
incommensurate phase and is $Pn'ma(0b0)00s$ for the 2-${\bf k}$ magnetic phase.
We propose a simplified magnetic structure model taking into account the major
ordered contributions, where the commensurate ${\bf k}_{2}$ defines the
ordering of the $c$-axis component of Mn1 magnetic moment, while the
incommensurate ${\bf k}_{1}$ describes the ordering of the $ab$-plane
components of both Mn1 and Mn2 moments into elliptical cycloids

parameters adjusted to fix binding energy, saturation density, symmetry energy,
and incompressibility, is analyzed under symmetric and asymmetric nuclear
matter constraints. In a previous paper, it was shown that this model is fully
consistent with the constraints related to the binary neutron star merger event
named GW170817 and reported by the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. Here, we show
that it also describes satisfactorily the low and high-density regions of
symmetric nuclear matter, with all the main constraints satisfied. We also
found a linear correlation between the incompressibility and the skewness
parameter, both at the saturation density and show how it relates to the
crossing point presented in the incompressibility as a function of the density.
In the asymmetric matter regime, other linear correlations are found, namely,
the one between the symmetry energy ($J$) and its slope ($L_0$), and other one
establishing the symmetry energy curvature as a function of the combination
given by $3J-L_0$.

coverage of OTELO, we are able to determine the faint end of the LF, and thus
better constrain the star formation rate and the number of galaxies at low

of the multi-wavelength catalogue of objects in the field compiled by the OTELO

take advantage of the pseudo-spectra built for each source, which allow the
identification of emission lines and the discrimination of different types of
objects. The H$\alpha$ luminosity function at $z\sim0.40$ is obtained, which
extends the current faint end by almost 1 dex, reaching minimal luminosities of
$\log_{10}L_{\rm lim}=38.5$ erg s$^{-1}$ (or $\sim0.002\, \text{M}_\odot\text{

forming region is a promising site for studying young sub-stellar objects, yet
the low-mass members of this region remain largely undiscovered. In this paper
we report on a deep photometric survey using a custom 1.45 um filter (W-band),
as well as standard J and H near-IR filters, in order to identify candidate
low-mass young brown-dwarfs in the Serpens-South region. We constructed a

survey objects, in order to identify candidate low-mass members of Serpens
based on the strength of the water absorption feature at 1.45 um in the
atmospheres of mid-M and later objects. We then conducted spectroscopic follow
up to confirm youth and spectral type for our candidates. This is the first
survey to identify the very low-mass and coolest members of Serpens-South. We
identify 4 low-mass candidate Serpens members, which all display IR excess
emission, indicating the likely presence of circumstellar disks around them.

galaxies on 30 pc to kpc scales using HST WFC3 multi-band imaging. The star
formation histories of these hosts are diverse, including one post-starburst
galaxy (ASASSN-14li), two hosts with recent weak starbursts (ASASSN-14ae and
iPTF15af), and one early type (PTF09ge). Compared to early type galaxies of
similar stellar masses, the TDE hosts have higher central surface brightnesses
and stellar mass surface densities on 30-100 pc scales. The TDE hosts do not
show the large, kpc-scale tidal disruptions seen in some post-starburst
galaxies; the hosts have low morphological asymmetries similar to those of
early type galaxies. The lack of strong asymmetries are inconsistent with a
recent major (~1:1 mass) merger, although minor ($\lesssim$1:3) mergers are
possible. Given the time elapsed since the end of the starbursts in the three
post-burst TDE hosts and the constraints on the merger mass ratios, it is
unlikely that a bound supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) has had time to
coalesce. The TDE hosts have low central (<140 pc) ellipticities compared to
early type galaxies. The low central ellipticities disfavor a strong radial
anisotropy as the cause for the enhanced TDE rate, although we cannot rule out
eccentric disks at the scale of the black hole gravitational radius of
influence (~1 pc). These observations suggest that the high central stellar
densities are a more important driver than SMBHBs or radial anisotropies in
increasing the TDE rate in galaxies with recent starbursts.

  shell ejections on a 100 yr timescale from a massive yellow hypergiant","  Context. The fate of a massive star during the latest stages of its evolution
is highly dependent on its mass-loss rate/geometry and therefore knowing the
geometry of the circumstellar material close to the star and its surroundings
is crucial. Aims. We aim to study the nature (i.e. geometry, rates) of
mass-loss episodes. In this context, yellow hypergiants are great targets.
Methods. We analyse a large set of optical/near-infrared data, in spectroscopic
and photometric (X-shooter/VLT), spectropolarimetric (ISIS/WHT), and
interferometric GRAVITY-AMBER/VLTI) modes, toward the yellow hypergiant IRAS
17163-3907. We present the first model-independent reconstructed images of IRAS
17163-3907 at these wavelengths at milli-arcsecond scales. Lastly, we apply a
2D radiative transfer model to fit the dereddened photometry and the radial
profiles of published VISIR images at 8.59 {\mu}m, 11.85 {\mu}m and 12.81
{\mu}m simultaneously, adopting the revised Gaia distance (DR2). Results. The
interferometric observables around 2 {\mu}m show that the Br{\gamma} emission
is more extended and asymmetric than the Na i and the continuum emission. In
addition to the two known shells surrounding IRAS 17163-3907 we report on the
existence of a third hot inner shell with a maximum dynamical age of only 30
yr. Conclusions. The interpretation of the presence of Na i emission at closer
distances to the star compared to Br{\gamma} has been a challenge in various
studies. We argue that the presence of a pseudophotosphere is not needed, but
it is rather an optical depth effect. The three observed distinct mass-loss
episodes are characterised by different mass-loss rates and can inform the
theories on mass-loss mechanisms, which is a topic still under debate. We
discuss these in the context of photospheric pulsations and wind bi-stability
mechanisms.

2002.02509v1,2020-02-06,2020-02-06,Scalable Communication Endpoints for MPI+Threads Applications,"  Hybrid MPI+threads programming is gaining prominence as an alternative to the
traditional ""MPI everywhere'"" model to better handle the disproportionate
increase in the number of cores compared with other on-node resources. Current
implementations of these two models represent the two extreme cases of
communication resource sharing in modern MPI implementations. In the
MPI-everywhere model, each MPI process has a dedicated set of communication
resources (also known as endpoints), which is ideal for performance but is
resource wasteful. With MPI+threads, current MPI implementations share a single
communication endpoint for all threads, which is ideal for resource usage but
is hurtful for performance.
  In this paper, we explore the tradeoff space between performance and
communication resource usage in MPI+threads environments. We first demonstrate
the two extreme cases---one where all threads share a single communication
endpoint and another where each thread gets its own dedicated communication
endpoint (similar to the MPI-everywhere model) and showcase the inefficiencies
in both these cases. Next, we perform a thorough analysis of the different
levels of resource sharing in the context of Mellanox InfiniBand. Using the
lessons learned from this analysis, we design an improved resource-sharing
model to produce \emph{scalable communication endpoints} that can achieve the
same performance as with dedicated communication resources per thread but using
just a third of the resources.

2002.02563v1,2020-02-07,2020-02-07,Breaking Band: A Breakdown of High-performance Communication,"  The critical path of internode communication on large-scale systems is
composed of multiple components. When a supercomputing application initiates
the transfer of a message using a high-level communication routine such as an
MPI_Send, the payload of the message traverses multiple software stacks, the
I/O subsystem on both the host and target nodes, and network components such as
the switch. In this paper, we analyze where, why, and how much time is spent on
the critical path of communication by modeling the overall injection overhead
and end-to-end latency of a system. We focus our analysis on the performance of
small messages since fine-grained communication is becoming increasingly
important with the growing trend of an increasing number of cores per node. The
analytical models present an accurate and detailed breakdown of time spent in
internode communication. We validate the models on Arm ThunderX2-based servers
connected with Mellanox InfiniBand. This is the first work of this kind on Arm.
Alongside our breakdown, we describe the methodology to measure the time spent
in each component so that readers with access to precise CPU timers and a PCIe
analyzer can measure breakdowns on systems of their interest. Such a breakdown
is crucial for software developers, system architects, and researchers to guide
their optimization efforts. As researchers ourselves, we use the breakdown to
simulate the impacts and discuss the likelihoods of a set of optimizations that
target the bottlenecks in today's high-performance communication.

  metal-semiconductor hybrid contact","  Using NRG, we show that a system containing a quantum impurity (QI), strongly
coupled to a semiconductor (gap $2 \Delta$) and weakly coupled to a metal,
displays a 'reentrant' Kondo stage at low temperatures. The NRG analysis of the
corresponding Single Impurity Anderson Model (SIAM) shows that the reentrant
stage is characterized by a second sequence of SIAM fixed points: free orbital
(FO) > local moment (LM) > strong coupling (SC). In the first stage, the SC
fixed point (Kondo temperature $T_{K1}$) is unstable, while the second stage
exhibits a much lower Kondo temperature $T_{K2}$, associated to a stable SC
fixed point. The results indicate that the reentrant Kondo screening is
associated to an effective SIAM, with an effective repulsion $U_{eff}$. This
low temperature effective SIAM, which we dub as 'reentrant' SIAM, behaves as a
'replica' of the high temperature (bare) SIAM. The intuitive picture that
emerges is that the first Kondo state develops through impurity screening by
semiconducting electrons, while the second Kondo state involves screening by
metallic electrons, once the semiconducting electrons are out of reach to
thermal excitations ($T < \Delta$) and only the metallic spectral weight inside
the gap is available for impurity screening. In addition, we analyze a hybrid
system formed by a QI `sandwiched' between an armchair graphene nanoribbon
(AGNR) and a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with respective couplings
set to reproduce the generic model described above. The energy gap in the AGNR
can be externally tuned by an electric-field-induced Rashba spin-orbit
interaction. We analyzed this system for realistic parameter values, using NRG,
and concluded that the reentrant SIAM, with its associated second stage Kondo,
is worthy of experimental investigation.

  Calculations of Molecular Crystals: The Instructive Case of Naphthalene","  Phonons crucially impact a variety of properties of organic semiconductor
materials. For instance, charge- and heat transport depend on low-frequency
phonons, while for other properties, such as the free energy, especially
high-frequency phonons count. For all these quantities one needs to know the
entire phonon band structure, whose simulation becomes exceedingly expensive
for more complex systems when using methods like dispersion-corrected density
functional theory (DFT). Therefore, in the present contribution we evaluate the
performance of more approximate methodologies, including density functional
tight binding (DFTB) and a pool of force fields (FF) of varying complexity and
sophistication. Beyond merely comparing phonon band structures, we also
critically evaluate to what extent derived quantities, like
temperature-dependent heat capacities, mean squared thermal displacements and
temperature-dependent free energies are impacted by shortcomings in the
description of the phonon bands. As a benchmark system, we choose (deuterated)
naphthalene, as the only organic semiconductor material for which to date
experimental phonon band structures are available in the literature. Overall,
the best performance amongst the approximate methodologies is observed for a
system-specifically parametrized second-generation force field. Interestingly,
in the low-frequency regime also force fields with a rather simplistic model
for the bonding interactions (like the General Amber Force Field) perform
rather well. As far as the tested DFTB parametrization is concerned, we obtain
a significant underestimation of the unit cell volume resulting in a pronounced
overestimation of the phonon energies in the low frequency region. This cannot
be mended by relying on the DFT-calculated unit cell, since with this unit cell
the DFTB phonon frequencies significantly underestimate the experiments.

  Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud","  The process of massive star ($M\geq8~M_\odot$) formation is still poorly
understood. Observations of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) are
challenging due to their rarity, short formation timescale, large distances,
and high circumstellar extinction. Here, we present the results of a
spectroscopic analysis of a population of MYSOs in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC). We took advantage of the spectral resolution and wavelength coverage of
X-shooter (300-2500 nm), mounted on the European Southern Observatory Very
Large Telescope, to detect characteristic spectral features in a dozen MYSO
candidates near 30 Doradus, the largest starburst region in the Local Group
hosting the most massive stars known. The X-shooter spectra are strongly
contaminated by nebular emission. We used a scaling method to subtract the
nebular contamination from our objects. We detect H$\alpha,\beta$, [O I] 630.0
nm, Ca II infrared triplet, [Fe II] 1643.5 nm, fluorescent Fe II 1687.8 nm,
H$_2$ 2121.8 nm, Br$\gamma$, and CO bandhead emission in the spectra of
multiple candidates. This leads to the spectroscopic confirmation of 10
candidates as bona fide MYSOs. We compare our observations with photometric
observations from the literature and find all MYSOs to have a strong
near-infrared excess. We compute lower limits to the brightness and luminosity
of the MYSO candidates, confirming the near-infrared excess and the massive
nature of the objects. No clear correlation is seen between the Br$\gamma$
luminosity and metallicity. Combining our sample with other LMC samples results
in a combined detection rate of disk features such as fluorescent Fe II and CO
bandheads which is consistent with the Galactic rate (40\%). Most of our MYSOs
show outflow features.

vibrational field unperturbed by its presence, so to achieve its invisibility,
is a thoroughly analyzed, but still unchallenged, mechanical problem. The
'cloaking transformation' concept, originally developed in electromagnetism and
optics, is not directly applicable to elastic waves, displaying a complex
vectorial nature. Consequently, all examples of elastic cloaking presented so
far involve complex design and thick coating skins. These cloakings often work
only for problems of unidirectional propagation, within narrow ranges of
frequency, and considering only one colaked object. Here, a new method based on
the concept of reinforcement, achieved via elastic stiffening and mass
redistribution, is introduced to cloak multiple voids in an elastic plate. This
simple technique produces invisibility of the voids to flexural waves within an
extremely broad range of frequencies and thus surpassing in many aspects all
existing cloaking techniques. The proposed design principle is applicable in
mechanical problems ranging from the micro-scale to the scale of civil
engineering. For instance, our results show how to design a perforated
load-bearing building wall, vibrating during an earthquake exactly as the same
wall, but unperforated, a new finding for seismic protection.

space of a system of two coupled, non-resonantly driven exciton-polariton
condensates. The typical scenario of bifurcations experienced by the system
with increasing external pumping consists of (i) formation of
$\pi$-synchronized condensates at low pumping, (ii) symmetry breaking pitchfork
bifurcation leading to unequal occupations of the condensates with non-trivial
phase difference between them, (iii) loss of the stability of all fixed points
in the system resulting in chaotic dynamics, (iv) limit cycle dynamics of the
order parameter, which ends up in (v) in-phase synchronized condensates via the
Hopf bifurcation from a limit cycle. The chaotic dynamics of the order
parameter is evidenced by calculating the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The
presence of a chaotic domain is studied as a function of polariton-polariton
interaction and the Josephson coupling between the condensates. At some values
of the parameters the bifurcation route is more complex and the strange
attractor can coexist with the stable fixed-point lasing. We also investigate

life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often
health conditions can detrimentally affect a person's ability to interact with

For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of
healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people

social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below.
We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform,
motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have.
In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform:
a) changing how the person is perceived, b) enhancing the social behavior of
the person, c) modifying the social behavior of others, d) providing structure
for interactions, and e) changing how the person feels. We thematically
organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human-human
interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the
findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions
identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in
designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities

observe both second- and third-order magnonic EPs by tuning the interlayer
coupling strength, the external magnetic field, and the gain-loss parameter. We
show that the magnetic sensitivity can be enhanced by $3$ orders of magnitude

2002.03110v1,2020-02-08,2020-02-08,Entropy and Mass Distribution in Disc Galaxies,"  The relaxed motion of stars and gas in galactic discs is well approximated by
a rotational velocity that is a function of radial position only, implying that
individual components have lost any information about their prior states.
Thermodynamically, such an equilibrium state is a microcanonical ensemble with
maximum entropy, characterised by a lognormal probability distribution.
Assuming this for the surface density distribution yields rotation curves that
closely match observational data across a wide range of disc masses and galaxy
types, and provides a useful tool for modelling the theoretical density
distribution in the disc. A universal disc spin parameter emerges from the
model, giving a tight virial mass estimator with strong correlation between
angular momentum and disc mass, suggesting a mechanism by which the proto-disc
developed by dumping excess mass to the core, or excess angular momentum to a
satellite galaxy. The baryonic-to-dynamic mass ratio for the model approaches
unity for high mass galaxies, but is generally $<1$ for low mass discs, and
this discrepancy appears to follow a similar relationship to that shown in
recent work on the radial acceleration relation (RAR). Although this may
support Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in preference to a dark matter (DM)
halo, it does not exclude undetected baryonic mass or a gravitational DM
component in the disc.

linearly and circularly polarized light irradiation have been theoretically
studied. Since TMMs have the double-layered Kagome lattice structures for their
$\pi$-electrons, i.e., tiling of trigonal and hexagonal-symmetric rings, the
electronic band structures of TMMs have non-equivalent Dirac cones and perfect
flat bands. By constructing the tight-binding model to describe the
pi-electronic states of TMMs, we have evaluated the optical absorption
intensities and valley selective excitation of TMMs based on the Kubo formula.
It is found that absorption intensities crucially depend on both light
polarization angle and the excitation position in momentum space, i.e., the
momentum and valley selective optical excitation. The polarization dependence

can make stigmatically images for geometric optics in two dimensional space.
One is called the duplex Mikaelian lens, which is made by splicing two half
Mikaelian lenses with different periods. The other is exponential conformal
transformer of duplex Mikaelian lens with the ratio of different periods of its
two half Mikaelian lenses a rational number, which we call duplex Maxwell's
fish eye lens. Duplex Mikaelian lenses have continuous translation symmetry
with arbitrary real number, while duplex Maxwell's fish eye lenses have
continuous rotational symmetry from 0 to 2*Pi. Hence each duplex Maxwell's fish
eye lens corresponds to a duplex Mikaelian lens. We further demonstrate the
caustic effect of geometric optics in duplex Mikaelian lenses and duplex
Maxwell's fish eye lenses. In addition, we investigate the Talbot effect of
wave optics in the duplex Mikaelian lens based on numeric calculations. Our
findings based on splicing and exponential conformal mapping enlarge the family
of absolute optical instruments.

approaches for navigating sparse environments require intrinsic reward
generators, such as the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) and Augmented
Curiosity Modules (ACM). Caps-EM uses a more compact architecture without need

and cosmology were truly immense. They began with the singularity theorems in
the 1960s followed by his discovery that black holes have an entropy and
consequently a finite temperature. Black holes were predicted to emit thermal
radiation, what is now called Hawking radiation. He pioneered the study of
primordial black holes and their potential role in cosmology. His organisation
of and contributions to the Nuffield Workshop in 1982 consolidated the picture
that the large-scale structure of the universe originated as quantum
fluctuations during the inflationary era. Work on the interplay between quantum
mechanics and general relativity resulted in his formulation of the concept of
the wavefunction of the universe. The tension between quantum mechanics and
general relativity led to his struggles with the information paradox concerning
deep connections between these fundamental areas of physics.
  These achievements were all accomplished following the diagnosis during the
early years of Stephen's studies as a post-graduate student in Cambridge that
he had incurable motor neuron disease -- he was given two years to live.
Against all the odds, he lived a further 55 years. The distinction of his work
led to many honours and he became a major public figure, promoting with passion
the needs of disabled people. His popular best-selling book A Brief History of
Time made cosmology and his own work known to the general public worldwide. He
became an icon for science and an inspiration to all.

allows the user to induce one of the 11 faults of interest, so that their
effects on the performance of the engine are better understood. This minimizes
the risk of causing permanent damages to the engine and shortening its

machine based on a flexible element are addressed for the first time. A general
theoretical framework is developed by extending that of the classical
catastrophe machines made up of discrete elastic systems. The new formulation,
based on the nonlinear solution of the elastica, is enhanced by considering the
concept of the universal snap surface. Among the infinite set of elastica
catastrophe machines, two families are proposed and investigated to explicitly
assess their features. The related catastrophe locus is disclosed in a large
variety of shapes, very different from those generated by the classical
counterpart. Substantial changes in the catastrophe locus properties, such as
convexity and number of bifurcation points, are achievable by tuning the design
parameters of the proposed machines towards the design of very efficient
snapping devices. Experiments performed on the physical realization of the
elastica catastrophe machine fully validate the present theoretical approach.
The developed model can find applications in mechanics at different scales, for
instance, in the design of new devices involving actuation or hysteresis loop
mechanisms to achieve energy harvesting, locomotion, and wave mitigation.

essential requirement for multicellular eukaryotes on Earth while
simultaneously posing a threat to their survival via the formation of reactive

complex life are invoked to explore whether worlds with abiotic O$_2$
inventories can harbor such organisms. By taking the major O$_2$ sources and
sinks of Earth-like planets into account using a simple model, it is suggested
that worlds that receive time-averaged X-ray and extreme ultraviolet fluxes
that are $\gtrsim 10$ times higher than Earth might not be capable of hosting
complex lifeforms because the photolysis of molecules such as water may lead to
significant O$_2$ buildup. Methods for testing this hypothesis by searching for
anticorrelations between biosignatures and indicators of abiotic O$_2$
atmospheres are described. In the event, however, that life successfully adapts
to high-oxygen environments, these worlds could permit the evolution of large

forming a bound state can protect the quantumness against a dissipative ambient

  electro-hydraulic systems","  An adaptive-gain super-twisting sliding mode observer is proposed for fault
reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems (EHSS) receiving bounded
perturbations with unknown bounds. The objective is to address challenging
problems in classic sliding mode observers: chattering effect, conservatism of
observer gains, strong condition on the distribution of faults and
uncertainties. In this paper, the proposed super-twisting sliding mode observer
relaxes the condition on the distribution of uncertainties and faults, and the
gain adaptation law leads to eliminate observer gain overestimation and
attenuate chattering effects. After using the equivalent output-error-injection
feature of sliding mode techniques, a fault reconstruction strategy is
proposed. The experimental results are presented, confirming the effectiveness
of the proposed adaptive super-twisting observer for precise fault
reconstruction in electro-hydraulic servo systems.

2002.03526v1,2020-02-10,2020-02-10,Identifying defect-related quantum emitters in monolayer WSe$_2$,"  Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides have recently attracted great
interests because the quantum dots embedded in monolayer can serve as optically
active single photon emitters. Here, we provide an interpretation of the
recombination mechanisms of these quantum emitters through
polarization-resolved and magneto-optical spectroscopy at low temperature.
Three types of defect-related quantum emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide
(WSe$_2$) are observed, with different exciton g factors of 2.02, 9.36 and
unobservable Zeeman shift, respectively. The various magnetic response of the
spatially localized excitons strongly indicate that the radiative recombination
stems from the different transitions between defect-induced energy levels,
valance and conduction bands. Furthermore, the different g factors and
zero-field splittings of the three types of emitters strongly show that quantum
dots embedded in monolayer have various types of confining potentials for
localized excitons, resulting in electron-hole exchange interaction with a
range of values in the presence of anisotropy. Our work further sheds light on
the recombination mechanisms of defect-related quantum emitters and paves a way
toward understanding the role of defects in single photon emitters in
atomically thin semiconductors.

  submillimeter galaxies -- Insights into dust distributions and star-formation
  rates at $z\sim2$","  Using data from ALMA and near-infrared (NIR) integral field spectrographs
including both SINFONI and KMOS on the VLT, we investigate the two-dimensional
distributions of H$\alpha$ and rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) continuum in six
submillimeter galaxies at $z\sim2$. At a similar spatial resolution ($\sim$0.5""
FWHM; $\sim$4.5 kpc at $z=2$), we find that the half-light radius of H$\alpha$
is significantly larger than that of the FIR continuum in half of the sample,
and on average H$\alpha$ is a median factor of $2.0\pm0.4$ larger. Having
explored various ways to correct for the attenuation, we find that the
attenuation-corrected H$\alpha$-based SFRs are systematically lower than the
IR-based SFRs by at least a median factor of $3\pm1$, which cannot be explained
by the difference in half-light radius alone. In addition, we find that in 40%
of cases the total $V$-band attenuation ($A_V$) derived from energy balance
modeling of the full ultraviolet(UV)-to-FIR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) is significantly higher than that derived from SED modeling using only
the UV-to-NIR part of the SEDs, and the discrepancy appears to increase with
increasing total infrared luminosity. Finally, considering all our findings
along with the studies in the literature, we postulate that the dust
distributions in SMGs, and possibly also in less IR luminous $z\sim2$ massive
star-forming galaxies, can be decomposed into three main components; the
diffuse dust heated by older stellar populations, the more obscured and
extended young star-forming HII regions, and the heavily obscured central
regions that have a low filling factor but dominate the infrared luminosity in
which the majority of attenuation cannot be probed via UV-to-NIR emissions.

  variability and correlation studies","  We report on variability and correlation studies using multiwavelength
observations of the blazar Mrk 421 during the month of February, 2010 when an
extraordinary flare reaching a level of $\sim$27~Crab Units above 1~TeV was
measured in very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays with the VERITAS observatory.
This is the highest flux state for Mrk 421 ever observed in VHE $\gamma$-rays.
Data are analyzed from a coordinated campaign across multiple instruments
including VHE $\gamma$-ray (VERITAS, MAGIC), high-energy (HE) $\gamma$-ray
(Fermi-LAT), X-ray (Swift}, RXTE, MAXI), optical (including the GASP-WEBT
collaboration and polarization data) and radio (Mets\""ahovi, OVRO, UMRAO).
Light curves are produced spanning multiple days before and after the peak of
the VHE flare, including over several flare `decline' epochs. The main flare
statistics allow 2-minute time bins to be constructed in both the VHE and
optical bands enabling a cross-correlation analysis that shows evidence for an
optical lag of $\sim$25-55 minutes, the first time-lagged correlation between
these bands reported on such short timescales. Limits on the Doppler factor
($\delta \gtrsim 33$) and the size of the emission region ($ \delta^{-1}R_B
\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{13}\,\,\mbox{cm}$) are obtained from the fast
variability observed by VERITAS during the main flare. Analysis of
10-minute-binned VHE and X-ray data over the decline epochs shows an
extraordinary range of behavior in the flux-flux relationship: from linear to
quadratic to lack of correlation to anti-correlation. Taken together, these
detailed observations of an unprecedented flare seen in Mrk 421 are difficult
to explain by the classic single-zone synchrotron self-Compton model.

  using SimpleHypergraphs.jl","  Real-world complex networks are usually being modeled as graphs. The concept
of graphs assumes that the relations within the network are binary (for
instance, between pairs of nodes); however, this is not always true for many
real-life scenarios, such as peer-to-peer communication schemes, paper
co-authorship, or social network interactions. For such scenarios, it is often
the case that the underlying network is better and more naturally modeled by
hypergraphs. A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which a single
(hyper)edge can connect any number of vertices. Hypergraphs allow modelers to
have a complete representation of multi-relational (many-to-many) networks;
hence, they are extremely suitable for analyzing and discovering more subtle
dependencies in such data structures.
  Working with hypergraphs requires new software libraries that make it
possible to perform operations on them, from basic algorithms (such as
searching or traversing the network) to computing significant hypergraph
measures, to including more challenging algorithms (such as community
detection). In this paper, we present a new software library,
SimpleHypergraphs.jl, written in the Julia language and designed for
high-performance computing on hypergraphs and propose two new algorithms for
analyzing their properties: s-betweenness and modified label propagation.
  We also present various approaches for hypergraph visualization integrated
into our tool. In order to demonstrate how to exploit the library in practice,
we discuss two case studies based on the 2019 Yelp Challenge dataset and the
collaboration network built upon the Game of Thrones TV series. The results are
promising and they confirm the ability of hypergraphs to provide more insight
than standard graph-based approaches.

the sparsity of the Hawking radiation cascade. Also, the greybody factor

made of 361 stars in spectral classes F to G, in the magnitude range 4-9, with
detection sensitivity at the level of or better than 10E-5 (0.001 %).
Statistically significant (>3 sigma) polarization is found in 115 stars, and >
2 sigma detection in 178 stars, out of the total sample of 361 stars.
Polarization maps based on these data show filament-like patterns of
polarization position angles which are related to both the heliosphere

between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD) can be one of the
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs and notices that the repeating FRBs can also
be explained if a magnetar formed after such NS-WD merger. In this paper, we
investigate this channel of magnetar formation in more detail. We propose that
the NS-WD post-merger, after cooling and angular momentum redistribution, may
collapse to either a black hole or a new NS or even remains as a hybrid WDNS,
depending on the total mass of the NS and WD. In particular, the newly formed
NS can be a magnetar if the core of the WD collapsed into the NS while large
quantities of degenerate electrons of the WD compressed to the outer layers of
the new NS. A strong magnetic field can be formed by the electrons and positive
charges with different angular velocities induced by the differential rotation
of the newborn magnetar. Such a magnetar can power the repeating FRBs by the
magnetic reconnections due to the crustal movements or starquakes.

additional periodic potential which dimensionless amplitude $K$ determines
three main phases available for quantum computations: at zero $K$ we have the
case of Cirac-Zoller quantum computer, below a certain critical amplitude
$K<K_c$ the ions are in the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) phase, with
delocalized phonon modes and free chain sliding, and above the critical
amplitude $K>K_c$ ions are in the pinned Aubry phase with a finite frequency
gap protecting quantum gates from temperature and other external fluctuations.
For the Aubry phase, in contrast to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM phases, the phonon
gap remains independent of the number of ions placed in the trap keeping a
fixed ion density around the trap center. We show that in the Aubry phase the
phonon modes are much better localized comparing to the Cirac-Zoller and KAM
cases. Thus in the Aubry phase the recoil pulses lead to local oscillations of
ions while in other two phases they spread rapidly over the whole ion chains
making them rather sensible to external fluctuations. We argue that the
properties of localized phonon modes and phonon gap in the Aubry phase provide
advantages for the ion quantum computations in this phase with a large number

observations were used to derive the population and mass indices, flux, and

2002.03946v2,2020-02-10,2020-02-10,A fundamental test for MOND,"  The Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) shows a strong correlation between two
accelerations associated to galaxy rotation curves. The relation between these
accelerations is given by a nonlinear function which depends on an acceleration
scale $a_\dagger$. Some have interpreted this as an evidence for a gravity
model, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which posits a fundamental
acceleration scale $a_0$ common to all the galaxies. However, it was later
shown, using Bayesian inference, that this seems not to be the case: the $a_0$
credible intervals for individual galaxies were not found to be compatible
among themselves. This type of test is a fundamental test for MOND as a theory
for gravity, since it directly evaluates its basic assumption and this using
the data that most favor MOND: galaxy rotation curves. Here we improve upon the
previous analyses by introducing a more robust method to assess the
compatibility between the credible intervals, in particular without Gaussian
approximations. We directly estimate, using a Monte Carlo simulation, that the
existence of a fundamental acceleration is incompatible with the data at more
than $5\sigma$. We also consider quality cuts in order to show that our results
are robust against outliers. In conclusion, the new analysis further supports
the claim that the acceleration scale found in the RAR is an emergent quantity.

and the fermion vertex function is presented at one loop in the context of
quantum electrodynamics (QED) with 1 extra dimension. In 5-dimensional
theories, characterized by an infinite number of Kaluza-Klein fields, one-loop
amplitudes involve discrete as well as continuous sums, $\sum^\infty_{n=1}\int
d^4k$, that could diverge. Using dimensional regularization, we express such
sums as products of gamma and Epstein functions, both defined on the complex
plane, with divergences arising from poles of these functions in the limit as $
D \to 4$. Using the analytical properties of the Epstein function, we show that
the ultraviolet divergences generated by the Kaluza-Klein sums can be
consistently renormalized, which means that the corresponding renormalized
quantities reduce to the usual ones of QED at the limit of a very large
compactification scale $R^{-1}$. The main features of QED at the one-loop level
were studied. We use the mass-dependent $\mu$-scheme to calculate, in QED with
an arbitrary number $n$ of extra dimensions, a beta function fulfilling all
desirable physical requirements. We argue that in this type of theories, with a
large mass spectrum covering a wide energy range, beta functions should not be
calculated by using mass-independent renormalization schemes. We show that the
beta function is finite for any energy $\mu$. In particular, it reduces to the
usual QED result $e^3/12\pi^2$ for $m\ll \mu \ll R^{-1}$ and vanishes for $m\gg
\mu$, with $m$ the usual fermion mass. Throughout the work, the decoupling

evolution of stellar black hole binaries (BHBs) around supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). We show that dynamical interactions can efficiently drive ""in-situ""
BHB formation if the SMBH is surrounded by a massive nuclear cluster (NC),
while orbitally segregated star clusters can replenish the BHB reservoir in
SMBH-dominated nuclei. We discuss how the combined action of stellar hardening
and mass segregation sculpts the BHB orbital properties. We use direct N-body
simulations including post-Newtonian corrections up to 2.5 order to study the
BHB-SMBH interplay, showing that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays a crucial role
in shortening binaries lifetime. We find that the merging probability weakly
depends on the SMBH mass in the $10^6-10^9{\rm ~M}_\odot$ mass range, leading
to a merger rate $\Gamma \simeq 3-8$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift zero.
Nearly $40\%$ of the mergers have masses in the ""BH mass gap"", $50-140{\rm
~M}_\odot$, thus indicating that galactic nuclei are ideal places to form BHs
in this mass range. We argue that gravitational wave (GW) sources with
components mass $m_1>40{\rm ~M}_\odot$ and $m_2<30{\rm ~M}_\odot$ would
represent a strong indicator of a galactic nuclei origin. The majority of these
mergers could be multiband GW sources in the local Universe: nearly $40\%$
might be seen by LISA as eccentric sources and, a few years later, as circular
sources by LIGO and the Einstein Telescope, making decihertz observatories like

2002.04096v1,2020-02-10,2020-02-10,"Towards a distributed and infrastructure-less vehicular traffic
  management system","  In the past few years, several systems have been proposed to deal with issues
related to the vehicular traffic management. Usually, their solutions include
the integration of computational technologies such as vehicular networks,
central servers, and roadside units. Most systems use a hybrid approach, which
means they still need a central entity (central server or roadside unit) and
Internet connection to find out an en-route event as well as alternative routes
for vehicles. It is easy to understand the need for a central entity because
selecting the most appropriate vehicle to perform aforementioned procedures is
a difficult task. In addition to that, as far as we know, there are very few
systems that apply the altruistic approach (not selfish behavior) to routing
decisions. Because of that, the issue addressed in this work is how to perform
the vehicular traffic management, when an en-route event is detected, in a
distributed, scalable, and cost-effective fashion. To deal with these issues,
we proposed a distributed vehicle traffic management system, named as dEASY
(distributed vEhicle trAffic management SYstem). The dEASY system was designed
and implemented on a three-layer architecture, namely environment sensing and
vehicle ranking, knowledge generation and distribution, and knowledge
consumption. Each layer of the dEASY architecture is responsible for dealing
with the main issues that were not addressed in related works or could be
improved. Simulation results have shown that, compared with other systems from
the literature, our proposed system has lower network overhead due to applied
vehicle selection and broadcast suppression mechanisms. In average, dEASY also
outperformed all other competitors in what regards to the travel time and time

2002.04105v2,2020-02-10,2020-02-10,Polarimetric characterization of light and media,"  An analysis of the matrix models representing the polarimetric properties of
light and material media is carried out by using the concept of the coherency
matrix, which leads to the identification and definition of their corresponding
physical quantities. For light, cases of homogeneous and inhomogeneous
wavefront are analyzed, and a model for 3D polarimetric purity is formulated.
For linear passive material media, a general model is developed on the basis
that any physically realizable linear transformation of Stokes vectors is
equivalent to an ensemble average of passive, deterministic, nondepolarizing
transformations. Through this framework, the relevant physical quantities,
including the indices of polarimetric purity, are identified and decoupled.
Some decompositions of the whole system into a set of well-defined components
are considered, as well as techniques for isolating the unknown components by
means of new procedures for subtracting coherency matrices. These results and
methods constitute a powerful tool for analyzing and exploiting experimental
and industrial polarimetry. Some particular application examples are indicated.

dark energy and dark matter from a fundamental Lagrangian action first
principle, where all fundamental ingredients are systematically dynamically
generated starting from a very simple model of modified gravity interacting
with a single scalar field employing the formalism of non-Riemannian spacetime
volume-elements. The non-Riemannian volume element in the initial scalar field
action leads to a hidden nonlinear Noether symmetry which produces
energy-momentum tensor identified as a sum of a dynamically generated
cosmological constant and a dust-like dark matter. The non-Riemannian
volume-element in the initial Einstein-Hilbert action upon passage to the
physical Einstein-frame creates dynamically a second scalar field with a
non-trivial inflationary potential and with an additional interaction with the
dynamically generated dark matter. The resulting Einstein-frame action
describes a fully dynamically generated inflationary model coupled to dark
matter. Numerical results for observables such as the scalar power spectral
index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio conform to the latest 2018 PLANCK data.

radio-to-gamma-ray flux-density variability, with the addition of a couple of
short-time radio-structure and optical polarization observations of the blazar

30 TeV. Multiple strong GeV gamma-ray flares, a long-term increase in the
gamma-ray and optical flux baseline and a linear correlation between these two
bands are observed over the ten-year period. Typical HBL behaviors are
identified in the radio morphology and broadband spectrum of the source. Three
stationary features in the innermost jet are resolved by VLBA at 43.1, 22.2,

an extreme shift in energy of the synchrotron peak frequency from infrared to
soft X-rays is observed.

boundary-value problems of linear and nonlinear ordinary differential
equations. The presented method is based on the Theory of Functional
Connections, and is solved in two steps. First, the Theory of Functional
Connections analytically embeds the differential equation constraints into a
candidate function (called a $constrained \, expression$) that contains a
function that the user is free to choose. This expression always satisfies the
constraints, no matter what the free function is. Second, the free-function is
expanded as a linear combination of orthogonal basis functions with unknown
coefficients. The constrained expression (and its derivatives) are then
substituted into the eighth-order differential equation, transforming the
problem into an unconstrained optimization problem where the coefficients in
the linear combination of orthogonal basis functions are the optimization
parameters. These parameters are then found by linear/nonlinear least-squares.
The solution obtained from this method is a highly accurate analytical
approximation of the true solution. Comparisons with alternative methods
appearing in literature validate the proposed approach.

  observations and thermophysical and particle flux modeling","  Physical processing of Europan surface water ice by thermal relaxation,
charged particle bombardment, and possible cryovolcanic activity can alter the
percentage of the crystalline form of water ice compared to that of the
amorphous form of water ice (the ''crystallinity'') on Europa's surface. The
timescales over which amorphous water ice is thermally transformed to
crystalline water ice at Europan surface temperatures suggests that the water
ice there should be primarily in the crystalline form, however, surface
bombardment by charged particles induced by Jupiter's magnetic field, and vapor
deposition of water ice from Europan plumes, can produce amorphous water ice
surface deposits on short timescales. The purpose of this investigation is to
determine whether the Europan surface water ice crystallinity derived from
ground-based spectroscopic measurements is in agreement with the crystallinity
expected based on temperature and radiation modeling. Using a 1D thermophysical
model of Europa's surface, we calculate a full-disk crystallinity of Europa's
leading hemisphere by incorporating the thermal relaxation of amorphous to
crystalline water ice and the degradation of crystalline to amorphous water ice
by irradiation. Concurrently, we derive the full-disk crystallinity of Europa's
leading hemisphere using a comparison of near-infrared ground-based spectral
observations from Grundy et al. (1999), Busarev et al. (2018), and the Apache
Point Observatory with laboratory spectra from Mastrapa et al. (2018) and the
Ice Spectroscopy Lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We calculate a modeled
crystallinity significantly higher than crystallinities derived from
ground-based observations and laboratory spectra. This discrepancy may be a
result of geophysical processes, such as by vapor-deposited plume material, or
it may arise from assumptions and uncertainties in the crystallinity
calculations.

off processes, yielding precise control of the film thickness, placement, and
coating length. The high Kerr nonlinearity and low loss of the GO films
combined with the strong light matter interaction within the MRRs results in a
significant improvement in the FWM efficiency in the hybrid MRRs. Detailed FWM
measurements are performed at different pump powers and resonant wavelengths
for the uniformly coated MRRs with 1 to 5 layers of GO as well as the patterned
devices with 10 to 50 layers of GO. The experimental results show good
agreement with theory, achieving up to 7.6 dB enhancement in the FWM conversion
efficiency (CE) for an MRR uniformly coated with 1 layer of GO and 10.3 dB for
a patterned device with 50 layers of GO. By fitting the measured CE as a
function of pump power for devices with different numbers of GO layers, we also
extract the dependence of the third-order nonlinearity on layer number and pump
power, revealing interesting physical insights about the evolution of the
layered GO films from 2D monolayers to quasi bulk like behavior. These results
confirm the high nonlinear optical performance of integrated photonic
resonators incorporated with 2D layered GO films.

2002.04231v1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,Tuning of friction noise by accessing the rolling-sliding option,"  Variable power transmission in mechanical systems is often achieved by
devices, e.g., clutches and brakes, that use dry friction. In these systems,
the variability in power transmission is brought about by engaging and
disengaging the friction plates. Though commonly used, this method of making
the coupling noisy is not as versatile as their electrical analog. An
alternative method would be to intermittently vary the frictional force. In
this paper, we demonstrate a self-organized way to tune the noise in the
frictional coupling between two surfaces which are in relative motion with each
other. This is achieved by exploiting the complexity that arises from the
frictional interaction of the balls which are placed in a circular groove
between the surfaces. The extent of floppiness in the coupling is related to
the rate at which the balls make transitions between their rolling and sliding
states. If the moving surface is soft and the static surface is hard we show
that with increasing filling fraction of the balls the transitions between
rolling and sliding against the static surface give way to the transitions
between rolling and sliding against the moving surface. As a consequence, the
noise in the coupling is large for both small and large filling fraction with a
dip in the middle. In contrast, the sliding with the static surface is
suppressed if the moving pate is hard and the noise in the coupling decreases

2002.04234v1,2020-02-11,2020-02-11,Topological Protection and Control of Quantum Markovianity,"  Under the Born--Markov approximation, a qubit system, such as a two-level
atom, is known to undergo a memoryless decay of quantum coherence or excitation
when weakly coupled to a featureless environment. Recently, it has been shown
that unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian
effects and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to
Anderson localization. This~turns disorder into a resource for enhancing
non-Markovianity in the system--environment dynamics, which could be of
relevance in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence
dynamics of a qubit weakly coupled to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial
topological phase, such as a two-level atom embedded in a two-dimensional
coupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field realizing a quantum-Hall
bath, and~show that Markovianity is protected against moderate disorder owing
to the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath. Interestingly,
switching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological
trivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result
indicates that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic
gauge field can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum
information backflow in a qubit-environment system.

exist in two phases i.e. a major (90-94 pct.) and a minor (6-10 pct.). Based on
values of spectral parameters the former can be regarded as ferrous and the
latter as ferric. A sub spectrum associated with the ferric phase shows a
significant broadening below ca. 30 K corresponding to 7.5 kGs. A magnetic
origin of the effect was confirmed by the magnetization measurements. Evidence
on the effect of the magnetism on the lattice vibrations of Fe atoms in both
components was found. The Debye temperature, T_D, associated with the
vibrations of Fe2+ ions is by a factor of about 2 smaller in the temperature
range below ca. 30 K than the one determined from the data measured above ca.
30 K. Interestingly, the T_D-value found for the Fe3+ ions from the data
recorded below ca.30 K is about two times smaller than the corresponding value
determined for the Fe2+ ions.

  turbulence be reproduced with the aid of equilibrium solutions?","  This work employs for the first time invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes
equations to study the interaction between finite-size particles and near-wall
coherent structures. We consider horizontal plane Couette flow and focus on
Nagata's upper-branch equilibrium solution (Nagata, 1990) at low Reynolds
numbers where this solution is linearly stable. When adding a single heavy
particle with a diameter equivalent to 2.5 wall units, we observe that the
solution remains stable and is essentially unchanged away from the particle.
This result demonstrates that it is technically feasible to utilize exact
coherent structures in conjunction with particle-resolved DNS. While
translating in the streamwise direction, the particle migrates laterally under
the action of the quasi-streamwise vortices until it reaches the region
occupied by the low-speed streak, where it attains a periodic state of motion.
As a result of the ensuing preferential particle location, the time-average
streamwise particle velocity differs from the plane-average fluid-phase
velocity at the same wall-distance as the particle center, as previously
observed in experiments and in numerical data for fully turbulent wall-bounded
flows. Additional constrained simulations where the particle is maintained at a
fixed spanwise position while freely translating in the other two directions
reveal the existence of two equilibria located in the low-speed and in the
high-speed streak, respectively, the former being an unstable point. A
parametric study with different particle to fluid density ratios is conducted
which shows how inertia affects the spanwise fluctuations of the periodic
particle motion. Finally, we discuss a number of potential future
investigations of solid particle dynamics which can be conducted with the aid
of invariant solutions (exact coherent structures) of the Navier-Stokes
equations.

all-graphene electronics, we combine multiscale modeling tools to investigate
the structure and the electron and phonon transport properties of large

large enough flower densities, we find that electron transport is strongly
suppressed while, surprisingly, hole transport remains almost unaffected. These
results suggest possible applications of flowered graphene for electron energy
filtering. For the same defect densities, phonon transport is reduced by orders
of magnitude as elastic scattering by defects becomes dominant. Heat transport
by flexural phonons, key in graphene, is largely suppressed even for very low

hole spins in a wide range of astrophysical black holes regardless of their

galaxy III Zw 2 using multi-epoch XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Suzaku observations.
The X-ray spectra exhibit a soft-excess below 1 keV and a prominent excess at
the location of the broad Fe K{\alpha} line at 6.4 keV. To account for these
spectral features, we have fitted the spectra with multiple models including an
ionized partially covering absorber and an accretion disk reflection model. To
fully resolve the reflection component, we analyzed jointly the XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR observations taken in 2017 and archival XMM-Newton data from 2000.
Assuming the reflection scenario, the resulting model fits support a rapidly
spinning black hole (a > 0.98) in this radio-intermediate source. The X-ray
spectra in 2000 and 2017 are remarkably similar with the only difference in the
reflection fraction, possibly due to a change in the geometry of the accretion
flow. However, the Suzaku observation is markedly different, and we suggest
this could be an effect of a jet contribution in the X-ray band, which is
supported by the elevated radio flux during this observation.

candidate for 5G that can replace orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM). However, channel estimation (CE) is a big challenge in FBMC because it
suffers from intrinsic interference which is due to the orthogonality of the
subcarrier functions in the real field only. In this paper, we investigate a
proposed modified interference approximation scheme (M-IAM) by approximating
the intrinsic interference from the neighboring pilots to accommodate the
complex channel frequency and thus improving CE performance besides simplifying
its processing. The M-IAM scheme has larger pseudo pilot magnitude than other
conventional preamble schemes, namely the interference approximation method
(IAM) with its versions (IAM-C) and (E-IAM-C); in addition to the novel
preamble design (NPS). In addition, the proposed (M-IAM) scheme is
characterized by the lower transmitted power needed. The CE performance of the
M-IAM is investigated through 512 and 2048 subcarriers via different types of
outdoor and indoor multipath fading channels that are time-invariant such as
IEEE 802.22, IEEE 802.11, Rician, and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), as
well as time varying channels such as Rayleigh and Vehicular A (Veh-A).
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed M-IAM scheme achieves a lower
bit error rate (BER), lower normalized mean square error (NMSE) and lower
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) over the conventional preamble schemes under
the aforementioned channel models. The proposed scheme has the advantage of
saving the transmitted power, a requirement that could match 5G low power
requirements.

of rye s consumption. According to the results achieved it was concluded that
tall wheatgrass is better option than rye from the energy and the environmental
point of views and slight better option from the economic view. Considering
these results, monetarization of the CO2 eq reductions of tall wheatgrass
compared to rye is essential to improve its profit margin and promote the
implantation of this new crop in marginal areas of farms.

  collapse supernovae: A machine learning approach","  Based on the prior O1-O2 observing runs, about 30% of the data collected by
Advanced LIGO and Virgo in the next observing runs are expected to be
single-interferometer data, i.e., they will be collected at times when only one
detector in the network is operating in observing mode. Searches for
gravitational wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched
filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a
Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its
unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due
to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning
method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the
standard LIGO-Virgo coherentWave-Burst pipeline. We show that the method may be
used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise
transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the
supernova detection reach of the detectors.

theory to understand their rapid rotation, complex variability and decretion
disks. $\gamma$ Cassiopeiae ($\gamma$ Cas) is one such star but is even more
curious because of its unexplained hard thermal X-ray emission. Aims. We aim to
examine the optical variability of $\gamma$ Cas and thereby to shed more light
on its puzzling behaviour. Methods. Three hundred twenty-one archival H$\alpha$
spectra from 2006 to 2017 are analysed to search for frequencies corresponding
to the 203.5 day orbit of the companion. Space photometry from the SMEI
satellite from 2003 to 2011 and the BRITE-Constellation of nano-satellites
between 2015 and 2019 is investigated in the period range from a couple of
hours to a few days. Results. The orbital period of the companion of 203.5 days
is confirmed with independent measurements from the structure of the H$\alpha$
line emission. A strong blue/red asymmetry in the amplitude distribution across
the H$\alpha$ emission line could hint at a spiral structure in the decretion
disk. With the space photometry, the known frequency of 0.82 d$^{-1}$ is
confirmed in data from the early 2000s. A higher frequency of 2.48 d$^{-1}$ is
present in the data from 2015 to 2019 and possibly also in the early 2000s. A
third frequency at 1.25 d$^{-1}$ is proposed to exist in both SMEI and BRITE
data. The only explanation covering all three rapid variations seems to be
nonradial pulsation. The two higher frequencies are incompatible with rotation.

model with XX-type qubit-bath coupling is integrable for a central spin
$s_0=1/2$. Two types of eigenstates, separable states (dark states) and
entangled states (bright states) between the central spin and the bath spins,
are manifested. In this work, we show by using an operator product state
approach that the XX central spin model with central spin $s_0>1/2$ and
inhomogeneous coupling is partially solvable. That is, a subset of the
eigenstates are obtained by the operator product state ansatz. These are the
separable states and those entangled states in the single-spin-excitation
subspace with respect to the fully polarized reference state. Due to the high
degeneracy of the separable states, the resulting Bethe ansatz equations are
found to be non-unique. In the case of $s_0=1/2$ we show that all the separable
and entangled states can be written in terms of the operator product states,
recovering the results in [arXiv:2001.10008]. Moreover, we also apply our
method to the case of homogeneous coupling and derive the corresponding Bethe
ansatz equations.

  sufficient criteria for linear Gaussian quantum systems","  Quantum state smoothing is a technique for estimating the quantum state of a
partially observed quantum system at time $\tau$, conditioned on an entire
observed measurement record (both before and after $\tau$). However, this
smoothing technique requires an observer (Alice, say) to know the nature of the
measurement records that are unknown to her in order to characterize the
possible true states for Bob's (say) systems. If Alice makes an incorrect
assumption about the set of true states for Bob's system, she will obtain a
smoothed state that is suboptimal, and, worse, may be unrealizable (not
corresponding to a valid evolution for the true states) or even unphysical (not
represented by a state matrix $\rho\geq0$). In this paper, we review the
historical background to quantum state smoothing, and list general criteria a
smoothed quantum state should satisfy. Then we derive, for the case of linear
Gaussian quantum systems, a necessary and sufficient constraint for
realizability on the covariance matrix of the true state. Naturally, a
realizable covariance of the true state guarantees a smoothed state which is
physical. It might be thought that any putative true covariance which gives a
physical smoothed state would be a realizable true covariance, but we show
explicitly that this is not so. This underlines the importance of the
realizabilty constraint.

underlying continuum emission of the young submillimeter galaxy LESS 073 at
redshift 4.755, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
At the achieved resolution of
$\sim$$1^{\prime\prime}.2\times0^{\prime\prime}.9$ ($8\times6$~kpc$^2$), the
CO(7-6) emission is largely unresolved (with a deconvolved size of
$1^{\prime\prime}.1(\pm0^{\prime\prime}.5) \times
0^{\prime\prime}.9(\pm0^{\prime\prime}.8)$), and the continuum emission is
totally unresolved. The CO(7-6) line emission has an integrated flux of
$0.86\pm0.08$~Jy km/s, and a line width of $343\pm40$ km/s. The continuum
emission has a flux density of 0.51 mJy. By fitting the observed far-infrared
(FIR) spectral energy distribution of LESS 073 with a single-temperature
modified blackbody function, we obtained a dust temperature $T_{\rm
dust}=57.6\pm3.5$ K, 60-to-100 $\mu$m flux density ratio
$f_{60}/f_{100}=0.86\pm0.08$, and total infrared luminosity $L_{\rm

consistent with those estimated from various line ratios as advocated by our
earlier work, indicating that those proposed line-ratio-based method can be
used to practically derive $f_{60}/f_{100}$ for high-$z$ sources. The total
molecular gas mass of LESS 073 is $(3.3\pm1.7) \times10^{10}~M_\odot$, and the
inferred gas depletion time is about 43 Myr.

get, by means of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, the discrete spectrum of the
Hamiltonian of the Schr\""{o}dinger operator perturbed by an actractive 3D delta
interaction in a Friedmann flat universe. In particular, as a consequence of
the treatment in \cite{P1} suitable for a Minkowski spacetime, the discrete
spectrum of the ground state and the first exited state in the above mentioned
cosmic framework can be regained. Thus, the coupling constant $\lambda$ must be
choosen as a function of the cosmic comooving time $t$ as ${\lambda}/a^{2}(t)$,
with ${\lambda}$ be the one of the static Hamiltonian studied in \cite{P1}. In
this way we can introduce a time dependent delta interaction which is relevant
in a primordial universe, where $a(t)\rightarrow 0$ and becomes negligible at
late times, with $a(t)>>1$. We investigate, with the so obtained model, quantum
effects provided by point interactions in a strong gravitational regime near
the big bang. In particular, as a physically interesting application, we
present a method to depict, in a semi-classical approximation, a test particle
in a (non commutative) quantum spacetime where, thanks to Planckian effects,
the initial classical singularity disappears and as a consequnce a ground state
with negative energy emerges. Conversely, in a scenario where the scale factor
$a(t)$ follows the classical trajectory, this ground state is instable and thus
physically cannot be carried out.

is scrambled if the memory and environmental particles are alternatively
squeezed along two directions which are perpendicular to each other. Moreover,
the disorder and imperfection of the interaction strength tend to prevent the
information flow away to the environment and lead to the information scrambling
in the memory. We analyze the spatial distributions of the correlations in the

techniques.

time reversal symmetry breaking, exposed to magnetic field. A vortex in the
$s+id$ state tends to have an opposite phase winding between $s-$ and $d-$wave
condensates. We find that this peculiar feature together with the competition
between $s-$ and $d-$wave symmetry results in three distinct classes of
vortical configurations. When either $s-$ or $d-$ condensate absolutely
dominates, vortices form a conventional lattice. However, when one condensate
is relatively dominant, vortices organize in chains that exhibit skyrmionic
character, separating the chiral components of the $s \pm id$ order parameter
into domains within and outside the chain. Such skyrmionic chains are found
stable even at high magnetic field. When $s-$ and $d-$ condensates have a
comparable strength, vortices split cores in two chiral components to form
full-fledged skyrmions, i.e. coreless topological structures with an integer
topological charge, organized in a lattice. We provide characteristic magnetic
field distributions of all states, enabling their identification in e.g.
scanning Hall probe and scanning SQUID experiments. These unique vortex states
are relevant for high-T$_c$ cuprate and iron-based superconductors, where the
relative strength of competing pairing symmetries is expected to be tuned by

Here, we use tools from nonlinear dynamics to study the transition to

Interestingly, akin to the stability of asteroids in the Solar System,

  Decode-and-Forward Relay in Molecular Communication Systems","  Molecular communication (MC) allows nanomachines to communicate and cooperate
with each other in a fluid environment. The diffusion-based MC is popular but
is easily constrained by the transmit distance due to the severe attenuation of
molecule concentrations. In this letter, we present a decode-and-forward (DF)
relay strategy for the reversible binding receptor in the diffusion-based MC
system. The time-varying spatial distribution of the information molecules
based on the reversible association and dissociation between ligand and
receptor at the surface of receiver is characterized. An analytical expression
for the evaluation of expected error probability is derived, and the key
factors impacting on the performance are exploited. Results show that with a
constant molecular budget, the proposal can improve the performance
significantly, and the performance gain can be enhanced by optimizing the
position of the relay node and the number of molecules assigned to the source
node.

in cuprous oxide. Taking into account the coupling to the yellow series and
especially to the yellow continuum, the green excitons are quasi-bound
resonances with a finite lifetime which cannot be described with Hermitian
operators. To calculate their positions and linewidths, we use the method of
complex-coordinate rotation, leading to a non-Hermitian complex eigenvalue
problem. We find that the behavior of the dominant P states is very well
approximated by a modified Rydberg formula using a negative quantum defect. The
corresponding linewidths induced by the coupling to the yellow continuum
decrease with the third power of the principal quantum number.

central exclusive production cross sections of C-even mesons in $pA$ and $AA$
collisions, where $A$ is a heavy ion. We observe qualitatively different
behaviour of the contributions arising from $\gamma$-Odderon and
Pomeron-Pomeron fusion mechanisms. This can be used to extract the Odderon
signal from the events of $f_2$ mesons exclusively produced in the forward
region. Estimates, obtained using expected values of the Odderon cross section,
indicate that the $\gamma$-Odderon contribution may exceed by a few times the
Pomeron-induced background in Pb-Pb collisions. Moreover, the Odderon effect
can be clearly seen in terms of the asymmetry in $pA$ and $AA$ collisions with
the beam and target reversed. It is particularly interesting to note that the
asymmetry for $\gamma$-Odderon fusion reaches its maximum value close to 1 in
the forward direction, whereas the asymmetry for the Pomeron-Pomeron fusion
contribution is small. The role of additional interactions of the $f_2$ meson
with nucleons in the heavy ion, and also the contributions from secondary
Reggeons, are estimated. The photon-Odderon contribution has a large
normalisation uncertainty but the enhances cross-section in the forward region
combined with a large asymmetry increases the chance of experimentally
detecting the Odderon.

  social information flow","  Contagion models are a primary lens through which we understand the spread of
information over social networks. However, simple contagion models cannot
reproduce the complex features observed in real-world data, leading to research
on more complicated complex contagion models. A noted feature of complex
contagion is social reinforcement that individuals require multiple exposures
to information before they begin to spread it themselves. Here we show that the
quoter model, a model of the social flow of written information over a network,
displays features of complex contagion, including the weakness of long ties and
that increased density inhibits rather than promotes information flow.
Interestingly, the quoter model exhibits these features despite having no
explicit social reinforcement mechanism, unlike complex contagion models. Our
results highlight the need to complement contagion models with an
information-theoretic view of information spreading to better understand how
network properties affect information flow and what are the most necessary
ingredients when modeling social behavior.

2002.05106v1,2020-02-12,2020-02-12,A novel route to cyclic dominance in voluntary social dilemmas,"  Cooperation is the backbone of modern human societies, making it a priority
to understand how successful cooperation-sustaining mechanisms operate. Cyclic
dominance, a non-transitive setup comprising at least three strategies wherein
the first strategy overrules the second which overrules the third which, in
turn, overrules the first strategy, is known to maintain bio-diversity, drive
competition between bacterial strains, and preserve cooperation in social
dilemmas. Here, we present a novel route to cyclic dominance in voluntary
social dilemmas by adding to the traditional mix of cooperators, defectors, and
loners, a fourth player type, risk-averse hedgers, who enact tit-for-tat upon
paying a hedging cost to avoid being exploited. When this cost is sufficiently
small, cooperators, defectors, and hedgers enter a loop of cyclic dominance
that preserves cooperation even under the most adverse conditions. In contrast,
when the hedging cost is large, hedgers disappear, consequently reverting to
the traditional interplay of cooperators, defectors, and loners. In the interim
region of hedging costs, complex evolutionary dynamics ensues, prompting
transitions between states with two, three, or four competing strategies. Our
results thus reveal that voluntary participation is but one pathway to
sustained cooperation via cyclic dominance.

(23.7 mJy at 1.4 GHz) active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z>6.0. It was selected
by cross-matching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Panoramic Survey Telescope

a dedicated spectroscopic observation at the Large Binocular Telescope. A
pointed Neil Gehrels $Swift$ Observatory XRT observation allowed us to measure
a flux of $\sim$3.4$\times$10$^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the [0.5-10]
keV energy band, which also makes this object the X-ray brightest AGN ever
observed at z>6.0. Its flat radio spectrum ($\alpha_{\nu r}$<0.5), very high
radio loudness (R>10$^3$), and strong X-ray emission, compared to the optical,
support the hypothesis of the blazar nature of this source. %i.e. a radio-loud
(RL) AGN with the relativistic jet pointed toward us. Assuming that this is the
only blazar at this redshift in the surveyed area of sky, we derive a space
density of blazars at z$\sim$6 and with M$_{1450 \mbox{\AA}}$ < -25.1 of
5.5$^{+11.2}_{-4.6}$$\times$10$^{-3}$ Gpc$^{-3}$. From this number, and
assuming a reasonable value of the bulk velocity of the jet ($\Gamma$=10), we
can also infer a space density of the entire radio-loud AGN population at
z$\sim$6 with the same optical/UV absolute magnitude of 1.10$^{+2.53}_{-0.91}$
Gpc$^{-3}$. Larger samples of blazars will be necessary to better constrain
these estimates.

properties are important for multifunctional devices due to their potential
ability of controlling magnetism via electric field, and vice versa. The recent
discoveries of two-dimensional ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials have
ignited tremendous research interest and aroused hope to search for
two-dimensional multiferroics. However, intrinsic two-dimensional multiferroic
materials and, particularly, those with strong magnetoelectric couplings are
still rare to date. In this paper, using first-principles simulations, we
propose artificial two-dimensional multiferroics via a van der Waals
heterostructure formed by ferromagnetic bilayer chromium triiodide (CrI3) and
ferroelectric monolayer Sc2CO2. In addition to the coexistence of
ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity, our calculations show that, by switching
the electric polarization of Sc2CO2, we can tune the interlayer magnetic
couplings of bilayer CrI3 between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states.
We further reveal that such a strong magnetoelectric effect is from a dramatic
change of the band alignment induced by the strong build-in electric
polarization in Sc2CO2 and the subsequent change of the interlayer magnetic
coupling of bilayer CrI3. These artificial multiferroics and enhanced
magnetoelectric effect give rise to realizing multifunctional nanoelectronics
by van der Waals heterostructures.

responsible for the breakup of nanowires with the diamond cubic crystal
structure into a chain of nanoparticles discovered in preceding experiments on
Silicon nanowires. We show that this process is based on the well-known
mechanism of roughening transition, which specifically manifests itself in
quasi-one-dimensional systems/nanowires with a pronounced anisotropy of the
surface energy density. Depending on the temperature and orientation of the
nanowire relative to its internal crystal structure, the wavelengths of
substantial cross-sectional modulations exceed its initial radius by 4 to 18
times. For certain orientations, a straight nanowire at the initial stage of
evolution forms a serpentine/helical structure. The scenarios of the stage of
nanowire ruptures into single nanoclusters are also diverse: either each
spindle-shaped region of the nanowire transforms into a separate drop (by
long-wave surface perturbations), or the adjacent short-scale beads absorb each
other due to the Ostwald ripening effect, which can be accompanied by the
formation of long-lived many-body dumbbells. The discovered features of the
dynamics of quasi-onedimensional systems expand our conceptions of the physical
mechanisms involved in the breakup of nanowires (presented by Nichols and
Mullins as a classical model for such instabilities) which could be useful in
applications based on chains of ordered nanoparticles.

mapping of M16, one of the most famous star-forming regions in the Galaxy. The
data were acquired with the new imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SITELLE
mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We obtained three
spectral cubes with R=10'000 (SN1 filter), 1500 (SN2 filter) and 600 (SN3
filter), centered on the Pillars of Creation and the HH216 flow, covering the
main optical nebular emission lines: [O II]3726,29 (SN1), Hb, [O III]4959,5007
(SN2), [N II]6548,84, Ha, and [S II]6717,31 (SN3). We validate the performance,
calibration, and data reduction of SITELLE, and analyze the structures in the
large field-of-view in terms of their kinematics and nebular emission. We
compared the SITELLE data to MUSE integral field observations and other
spectroscopic and narrow-band imaging data to validate the performance of
SITELLE. We computed gas-phase metallicities via the strong-line method,
performed a pixel-by-pixel fit to the main emission lines to derive kinematics
of the ionized gas, computed the mass-loss rate of the Eastern pillar (the
Spire), and combined the SITELLE data with near-infrared narrow-band imaging to
characterize the HH216 flow. The comparison with previously published fluxes
demonstrates very good agreement. We disentangle the dependence of the
gas-phase metallicities (derived via abundance-tracing line ratios) on the
degree of ionization and obtain metallicities that are in excellent agreement
with the literature. We confirm the bipolar structure of HH216, find evidence
for episodic accretion from the source of the flow, and identify its likely
driving source. We compute the mass-loss rate of the Spire pillar on the East
side of the H II region and find excellent agreement with the correlation
between the mass-loss rate and the ionizing photon flux from the nearby cluster

2002.05343v1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,The origin of dust in galaxies across cosmic time,"  We study the dust evolution in galaxies by implementing a detailed dust
prescription in the SAGE semi-analytical model for galaxy formation. The new
model, called Dusty SAGE, follows the condensation of dust in the ejecta of
type II supernovae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, grain growth in the
dense molecular clouds, destruction by supernovae shocks, and the removal of
dust from the ISM by star formation, reheating, inflows and outflows. Our model
successfully reproduces the observed dust mass function at redshift z = 0 and
the observed scaling relations for dust across a wide range of redshifts. We
find that the dust mass content in the present Universe is mainly produced via
grain growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). By contrast, in the early
Universe, the primary production mechanism for dust is the condensation in
stellar ejecta. The shift of the significant production channel for dust
characterises the scaling relations of dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metal
(DTM) ratios. In galaxies where the grain growth dominates, we find positive
correlations for DTG and DTM ratios with both metallicity and stellar mass. On
the other hand, in galaxies where dust is produced primarily via condensation,
we find negative or no correlation for DTM and DTG ratios with either
metallicity or stellar mass. In agreement with observation showing that the
circumgalactic medium (CGM) contains more dust than the ISM, our model also
shows the same trend for z < 4. Our semi-analytic model is publicly available

telescope introduced at the neutron time of flight facility n_TOF at CERN. The
telescope has already been used in measurements of several neutron induced

highly detailed method is necessitated by the latest joint measurement of the
$^{12}$C($n,p$) and $^{12}$C($n,d$) reactions from n_TOF. The reliable analysis
of these data must account for the challenging nature of the involved
reactions, as they are affected by the multiple excited states in the daughter
nuclei and characterized by the anisotropic angular distributions of the
reaction products. The unabridged analysis procedure aims at the separate
reconstruction of all relevant reaction parameters - the absolute cross
section, the branching ratios and the angular distributions - from the integral
number of the coincidental counts detected by the separate pairs of silicon

2002.05720v1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Episodic accretion constrained by a rich cluster of outflows,"  The accretion history of protostars remains widely mysterious even though it
represents one of the best ways to understand the protostellar collapse that
leads to the formation of stars. Molecular outflows are here used to
characterize the protostellar accretion phase in W43-MM1. The W43-MM1
protocluster host a sufficient number of protostars to statistically
investigate molecular outflows in a single, homogeneous region. We used the
CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) line datacubes, taken as part of an ALMA mosaic with a
2000 AU resolution, to search for protostellar outflows, evaluate the influence
that the environment has on these outflows' characteristics and put constraints
on outflow variability in W43-MM1. We discovered a rich cluster of 46 outflow
lobes, driven by 27 protostars with masses of 1-100 Msun. The complex
environment inside which these outflow lobes develop has a definite influence
on their length, limiting the validity of using outflows' dynamical timescales
as a proxy of the ejection timescale in clouds with high dynamics and varying
conditions. We performed a detailed study of Position-Velocity (PV) diagrams of
outflows that revealed clear events of episodic ejection. The time variability
of W43-MM1 outflows is a general trend and is more generally observed than in
nearby, low- to intermediate-mass star-forming regions. The typical timescale
found between two ejecta, about 500 yr, is consistent with that found in nearby
protostars. If ejection episodicity reflects variability in the accretion
process, either protostellar accretion is more variable or episodicity is
easier to detect in high-mass star-forming regions than in nearby clouds. The
timescale found between accretion events could be resulting from disk
instabilities, associated with bursts of inflowing gas arising from the
dynamical environment of high-mass star-forming cores.

  Operators","  Recent experimental findings on anomalous diffusion have demanded novel
models that combine annealed (temporal) and quenched (spatial or static)
disorder mechanisms. The comb-model is a simplified description of diffusion on
percolation clusters, where the comb-like structure mimics quenched disorder
mechanisms and yields a subdiffusive regime. Here we extend the comb-model to
simultaneously account for quenched and annealed disorder mechanisms. To do so,
we replace usual derivatives in the comb diffusion equation by different
fractional time-derivative operators and the conventional comb-like structure
by a generalized fractal structure. Our hybrid comb-models thus represent a
diffusion where different comb-like structures describe different quenched
disorder mechanisms, and the fractional operators account for various annealed
disorders mechanisms. We find exact solutions for the diffusion propagator and
mean square displacement in terms of different memory kernels used for defining
the fractional operators. Among other findings, we show that these models
describe crossovers from subdiffusion to Brownian or confined diffusions,
situations emerging in empirical results. These results reveal the critical
role of interactions between geometrical restrictions and memory effects on
modeling anomalous diffusion.

2002.05436v1,2020-02-13,2020-02-13,Loss of toroidal magnetic flux by emergence of bipolar magnetic regions,"  The polarity of the toroidal magnetic field in the solar convection zone
periodically reverses in the course of the 11/22-year solar cycle. Among the
various processes that contribute to the removal of `old-polarity' toroidal
magnetic flux is the emergence of flux loops forming bipolar regions at the
solar surface. We quantify the loss of subsurface net toroidal flux by this
process. To this end, we determine the contribution of an individual emerging
bipolar loop and show that it is unaffected by surface flux transport after
emergence. Together with the linearity of the diffusion process this means that
the total flux loss can be obtained by adding the contributions of all emerging
bipolar magnetic regions. The resulting total loss rate of net toroidal flux
amounts to 1.3 X 10^{15} Mx/s during activity maxima and 6.1 X 10^{14} Mx/s
during activity minima, to which ephemeral regions contribute about 90% and
97%, respectively. This rate is consistent with the observationally inferred
loss rate of toroidal flux into interplanetary space and corresponds to a decay
time of the subsurface toroidal flux of about 12 years, also consistent with a
simple estimate based on turbulent diffusivity. Consequently, toroidal flux
loss by flux emergence is a relevant contribution to the budget of net toroidal
flux in the solar convection zone. That the toroidal flux loss rate due to flux
emergence is consistent with what is expected from turbulent diffusion, and
that the corresponding decay time is similar to the length of the solar cycle
are important constraints for understanding the solar cycle and the Sun's
internal dynamics.

the electric field (EF) in the different brain regions due to anatomical
complexity and high inter-subject variability. Personalized tDCS is an emerging
clinical procedure that is used to tolerate electrode montage for accurate
targeting. This procedure is guided by computational head models generated from
anatomical images such as MRI. Distribution of the EF in segmented head models
can be calculated through simulation studies. Therefore, fast, accurate, and
feasible segmentation of different brain structures would lead to a better
adjustment for customized tDCS studies. In this study, a single-encoder
multi-decoders convolutional neural network is proposed for deep brain
segmentation. The proposed architecture is trained to segment seven deep brain

group allows to create an explicitly given Lorentz invariant fermion wave. As
the generators are real valued they can be interpreted as a deformation tensor
in particular as a deformation tensor of space. Therefore, it is possible to
model a heuristic purely geometric representation of spin 1/2 in Minkowski
space. However the bigger surprise is that this wave has the space-time
structure of gravitational waves, which are understood to be spin 2 waves.
Given that the uniqueness of angular momentum representations still holds, the
examination of tensor rotations reveals the existence of different
representations of tensor rotations with a different angular parameter due to

great potential in a variety of situations, such as fast motion and low
illumination scenes. However, most of the event-based object tracking methods
are designed for scenarios with untextured objects and uncluttered backgrounds.
There are few event-based object tracking methods that support bounding
box-based object tracking. The main idea behind this work is to propose an
asynchronous Event-based Tracking-by-Detection (ETD) method for generic
bounding box-based object tracking. To achieve this goal, we present an
Adaptive Time-Surface with Linear Time Decay (ATSLTD) event-to-frame conversion
algorithm, which asynchronously and effectively warps the spatio-temporal
information of asynchronous retinal events to a sequence of ATSLTD frames with
clear object contours. We feed the sequence of ATSLTD frames to the proposed
ETD method to perform accurate and efficient object tracking, which leverages
the high temporal resolution property of event cameras. We compare the proposed
ETD method with seven popular object tracking methods, that are based on
conventional cameras or event cameras, and two variants of ETD. The
experimental results show the superiority of the proposed ETD method in
handling various challenging environments.

postulate that the first order statistics of speckle from tissue such as the
liver, thyroid, and prostate will follow a Burr distribution with a power law
parameter that can be related back to the underlying power law which governs
the branching network. However, the issue of scatterer spacing, or the number
of cylindrical vessels per sample volume of the interrogating pulse, has not
been directly addressed. This is now examined with a 3D simulation that varies
the number density and the governing power law parameter of an ensemble of
different sized cylinders. The Burr distribution is found to be an appropriate
model for the histogram of amplitudes from speckle regions, and the parameters
track the underlying conditions. These results are also tested in a more
general model of rat liver scans in normal vs. abnormal conditions, and the
resulting Burr distributions are also found to be appropriate and sensitive to
underlying scatterer distributions. These preliminary results suggest that the
classical Burr distribution may be useful in the quantification of scattering
of ultrasound from soft vascularized tissues.

clusters, where interactions with neighboring stars can help shape the system
architecture. This paper develops an orbit-averaged formalism to characterize
the cluster's mean-field effects as well as the physics of long-period stellar
encounters. Our secular approach allows for an analytic description of the
dynamical consequences of the cluster environment on its constituent planetary
systems. We analyze special cases of the resulting Hamiltonian, corresponding
to eccentricity evolution driven by planar encounters, as well as hyperbolic
perturbations upon dissipative disks. We subsequently apply our results to the
early evolution of our solar system, where the cluster's collective potential
perturbs the solar system's plane, and stellar encounters act to increase the
velocity dispersion of the Kuiper belt. Our results are two-fold: first, we
find that cluster effects can alter the mean plane of the solar system by
$\lesssim1\deg$, and are thus insufficient to explain the $\psi\approx6\deg$
obliquity of the sun. Second, we delineate the extent to which stellar flybys
excite the orbital dispersion of the cold classical Kuiper belt, and show that
while stellar flybys may grow the cold belt's inclination by the observed
amount, the resulting distribution is incompatible with the data.
Correspondingly, our calculations place an upper limit on the product of the
stellar number density and residence time of the sun in its birth cluster,

haloes (LAHs) as well as a first statistical analysis of the Lyman alpha (Lya)
spectral signature in the circum-galactic medium of high-redshift star-forming
galaxies using MUSE. Our resolved spectroscopic analysis of the LAHs reveals
significant intrahalo variations of the Lya line profile. Using a
three-dimensional two-component model for the Lya emission, we measure the full
width at half maximum (FWHM), the peak velocity shift and the asymmetry of the
Lya line in the core and in the halo of 19 galaxies. We find that the Lya line
shape is statistically different in the halo compared to the core for ~40% of
our galaxies. Similarly to object-by-object based studies and a recent resolved
study using lensing, we find a correlation between the peak velocity shift and
the width of the Lya line both at the interstellar and circum-galactic scales.
While there is a lack of correlation between the spectral properties and the
spatial scale lengths of our LAHs, we find a correlation between the width of
the line in the LAH and the halo flux fraction. Interestingly, UV bright
galaxies show broader, more redshifted and less asymmetric Lya lines in their
haloes. The most significant correlation found is for the FWHM of the line and
the UV continuum slope of the galaxy, suggesting that the redder galaxies have
broader Lya lines. The generally broad and red line shapes found in the halo
component suggests that the Lya haloes are powered either by scattering
processes through an outflowing medium, fluorescent emission from outflowing
cold clumps of gas, or a mix of both. Considering the large diversity of the
Lya line profiles observed in our sample and the lack of strong correlation,
the interpretation of our results is still broadly open and underlines the need
for realistic spatially resolved models of the LAHs.

insulators, can potentially display multipolar orders. We carry out an exact
diagonalization study of a simple octahedral crystal field Hamiltonian for two
electrons, incorporating spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and interactions, finding
that either explicitly including the $e_g$ orbitals, or going beyond the
rotationally invariant Coulomb interaction within the $t_{2g}$ sector, causes a
degeneracy breaking of the $J\!=\!2$ level degeneracy. This can lead to a
low-lying non-Kramers doublet carrying quadrupolar and octupolar moments and an
excited triplet which supports magnetic dipole moments, bolstering our previous
phenomenological proposal for the stabilization of ferro-octupolar order in
heavy transition metal oxides. We show that the spontaneous time-reversal
symmetry breaking due to ferro-octupolar ordering within the non-Kramers
doublet leads to electronic orbital loop currents. The resulting internal
magnetic fields can potentially explain the small fields inferred from
muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiments on cubic $5d^2$ osmate double
perovskites Ba$_2$ZnOsO$_6$, Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$, and Ba$_2$MgOsO$_6$, which were

and excited non-Kramers doublet, presenting single-ion results for the magnetic
susceptibility in this case, and pointing out its possible relevance for the

to be ideal tracers of the ionisation parameter. Unfortunately, we find that
current photoionisation models substantially over-predict [SIII] lines
intensity, while broadly reproducing other observed optical line ratios. We
discuss how to nonetheless make use of the information provided by [SIII] lines
by setting a prior on the ionisation parameter. Following this approach, we
derive spatially-resolved maps and radial profiles of metallicity and
ionisation parameter. The metallicity radial profiles are comparable with
previous works, with metallicity declining toward the outer parts and a
flattening in the central regions, in agreement with infall models of galaxy
formation, that predict that spiral discs build up through accretion of
material, which leads to an inside-out growth. On the other hand, ionisation
parameter radial profiles are flat for low-mass galaxies, while their slope
becomes positive as galaxy mass increases. However, the ionisation parameter
maps we obtain are clumpy, especially for low-mass galaxies. Ionisation
parameter is tightly correlated with the H$\alpha$ equivalent width
[EW(H$\alpha$)], following a nearly universal relation, which we attribute to
the change of the spectral shape of ionising sources due to ageing of HII
regions. We derive a positive correlation between ionisation parameter and
metallicity at fixed EW(H$\alpha$), in disagreement with previous theoretical
works expecting an anti-correlation.

select AGNs. An analysis was performed on the AGN population of OTELO in order

H$\alpha$ emitters are AGNs. At that redshift, AGNs are found in identical
environments to non-AGNs, although they represent the most clustered group when
compared to passive and star-forming galaxies. The majority of our AGNs at any
redshift were classified as late-type galaxies, including a 16\% proportion of
irregulars. Another 16\% of AGNs show signs of interactions or mergers.

commercial realization of holographic video display systems. HMHDs use liquid
crystal on silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulators (SLM), which are best suited
to display phase-only holograms (POH). The performance/watt requirement of a
monochrome, 60 fps Full HD, 2-eye, POH HMHD system is about 10 TFLOPS/W, which
is orders of magnitude higher than that is achievable by commercially available
mobile processors. To mitigate this compute power constraint, display-ready
POHs shall be generated on a nearby server and sent to the HMHD in compressed
form over a wireless link. This paper discusses design of a feasible HMHD-based
augmented reality system, focusing on compression requirements and per-pixel
rate-distortion trade-off for transmission of display-ready POH from the server
to HMHD. Since the decoder in the HMHD needs to operate on low power, only
coding methods that have low-power decoder implementation are considered.
Effects of 2D phase unwrapping and flat quantization on compression performance
are also reported. We next propose a versatile PCM-POH codec with progressive
quantization that can adapt to SLM-dynamic-range and available bitrate, and
features per-pixel rate-distortion control to achieve acceptable POH quality at
target rates of 60-200 Mbit/s that can be reliably achieved by current wireless
technologies. Our results demonstrate feasibility of realizing a low-power,

sensors. The IoT data allows creating profitable services using machine
learning. However, previous research does not address the problem of optimal
pricing and bundling of machine learning-based IoT services. In this paper, we
define the data value and service quality from a machine learning perspective.
We present an IoT market model which consists of data vendors selling data to
service providers, and service providers offering IoT services to customers.
Then, we introduce optimal pricing schemes for the standalone and bundled
selling of IoT services. In standalone service sales, the service provider
optimizes the size of bought data and service subscription fee to maximize its
profit. For service bundles, the subscription fee and data sizes of the grouped
IoT services are optimized to maximize the total profit of cooperative service
providers. We show that bundling IoT services maximizes the profit of service
providers compared to the standalone selling. For profit sharing of bundled
services, we apply the concepts of core and Shapley solutions from cooperative
game theory as efficient and fair allocations of payoffs among the cooperative
service providers in the bundling coalition.

decrease in communication costs and to the widespread of Internet-based labour
marketplaces (e.g., guru.com, feelancer.com, mturk.com, upwork.com), many
researchers and practitioners have started exploring the benefits of
outsourcing and crowdsourcing. Since employers often use these platforms to
find a group of workers to complete a specific task, researchers have focused
their efforts on the study of team formation and matching algorithms and on the
design of effective incentive schemes. Nevertheless, just recently, several
concerns have been raised on possibly unfair biases introduced through the
algorithms used to carry out these selection and matching procedures. For this
reason, researchers have started studying the fairness of algorithms related to
these online marketplaces, looking for intelligent ways to overcome the
algorithmic bias that frequently arises. Broadly speaking, the aim is to
guarantee that, for example, the process of hiring workers through the use of
machine learning and algorithmic data analysis tools does not discriminate,
even unintentionally, on grounds of nationality or gender. In this short paper,
we define the Fair Team Formation problem in the following way: given an online
labour marketplace where each worker possesses one or more skills, and where
all workers are divided into two or more not overlapping classes (for examples,
men and women), we want to design an algorithm that is able to find a team with
all the skills needed to complete a given task, and that has the same number of
people from all classes. We provide inapproximability results for the Fair Team
Formation problem together with four algorithms for the problem itself. We also
tested the effectiveness of our algorithmic solutions by performing experiments
using real data from an online labor marketplace.

calculations with the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling, we ($i$) identify
the origin of the different structural ($R3c$ vs. $Pnma$) properties using a
symmetry-adapted soft mode analysis, ($ii$) provide evidence that all
considered exchange-correlation functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, SCAN, and HSE06)
and the spin disordered polymorphous descriptions are unsatisfactory to
accurately describe the electronic and magnetic properties of both systems
simultaneously, and ($iii$) clarify that the distinct electronic (metallic vs.
insulating) properties originates mainly from a cooperative steric and magnetic
effect. Finally, we find that although at ambient pressure LiOsO$_3$ with a
$Pnma$ symmetry and NaOsO$_3$ with a $R\bar{3}c$ symmetry are energetically
unfavorable, they do not show soft phonons and therefore are dynamically
stable. A pressure-induced structural phase transition from $R3c$ to $Pnma$ for
LiOsO$_3$ is predicted, whereas for NaOsO$_3$ no symmetry change is discerned

essentially from helioseismic analyses of frequency splittings of resonant
acoustic waves. Here we present another, complementary estimation of the
internal solar rotation rate using the perturbation of the shape of the
acoustic waves. For this purpose, we extend a global helioseismic approach
developed previously for the investigation of the meridional flow
\cite{schad11, schad12, schad13} to work on the components of the differential
rotation. We discuss the effect of rotation on mode eigenfunctions and thereon
based observables. Based on a numerical study using a simulated rotation rate
profile we tailor an inversion approach and also consider the case of the
presence of an additional meridional flow. This inversion approach is then
applied to data from the MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager aboard the Solar
Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO)) instrument and the HMI (Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)) instrument. In the
end, rotation rate profiles estimated from eigenfunction perturbation and
frequency splittings are compared.
  The rotation rate profiles from the two different approaches are
qualitatively in good agreement, especially for the MDI data. Significant
differences are obtained at high latitudes $> 50^{\circ}$ and near the
subsurface. The result from HMI data shows larger discrepancies between the
different methods. We find that the two global helioseismic approaches provide
complementary methods for measuring solar rotation. Comparing the results from
different methods may help to reveal systematic influences that affect analyses

  and disc structure","  Hot, tenuous advection-dominated accretion flows around black holes are ideal
sites for the Fermi acceleration of relativistic particles at standing shock
waves in the accretion disc. Previous work has demonstrated that the
shock-acceleration process can be efficient enough to power the observed,
strong outflows in radio-loud active galaxies such as M87. However, the
dynamical effect (back-reaction) on the flow, exerted by the pressure of the
relativistic particles, has not been previously considered, and this effect can
have a significant influence on the disc structure. We reexamine the problem by
developing a new, two-fluid model for the structure of the accretion disc that
includes the dynamical effect of the relativistic particle pressure, combined
with the pressure of the background (thermal) gas. The new model is analogous
to the two-fluid model of cosmic ray acceleration in supernova-driven shock
waves. As part of the model, we also develop a new set of shock jump
conditions, which are solved along with the hydrodynamic conservation equations
to determine the structure of the accretion disc. The solutions include the
formation of a mildly relativistic outflow (jet) at the shock radius, driven by
the relativistic particles accelerated in the disc. One of our main conclusions
is that in the context of the new two-fluid accretion model, global smooth
(shock-free) solutions do not exist, and the disc must always contain a
standing shock wave, at least in the inviscid case considered here.

wavelengths up to TeV gamma-ray energies. The radio through GeV components have
been interpreted successfully using SSC models based on misaligned blazar jets,
but the origin of the intense TeV emission detected during flares in 2004,
2005, and 2010 remains puzzling. It has been previously suggested that the TeV
flares are produced when a relativistic proton jet originating in the core of
M87 collides with a molecular cloud (or stellar atmosphere) located less than
one parsec from the central black hole. We explore this scenario in detail here
using a self-consistent model for the acceleration of relativistic protons in a
shocked, two-fluid ADAF accretion disc. The relativistic protons accelerated in
the disc escape to power the observed jet outflows. The distribution function
for the jet protons is used to compute the TeV emission produced when the jet
collides with a cloud or stellar atmosphere. The simulated broadband radiation
spectrum includes radio, X-ray, and GeV components generated via synchrotron,
as well as TeV emission generated via the production and decay of muons,
positrons, and electrons. The self-consistency of the model is verified by
computing the relativistic particle pressure using the distribution function,
and comparing it with the relativistic particle pressure obtained from the

component, $\vec{d}_\perp$, through a Fourier analysis in right ascension that
includes weights for each event so as to account for the main detector-induced
systematic effects. For the energies at which the trigger efficiency of the
array is small, the ``East-West'' method is employed. Besides using the data
from the array with detectors separated by 1500 m, we also include data from
the smaller but denser sub-array of detectors with 750 m separation, which
allows us to extend the analysis down to $\sim 0.03$ EeV. The most significant
equatorial dipole amplitude obtained is that in the cumulative bin above 8~EeV,
$d_\perp=6.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$%, which is inconsistent with isotropy at the
6$\sigma$ level. In the bins below 8 EeV, we obtain 99% CL upper-bounds on
$d_\perp$ at the level of 1 to 3 percent. At energies below 1 EeV, even though
the amplitudes are not significant, the phases determined in most of the bins
are not far from the right ascension of the Galactic center, at $\alpha_{\rm
GC}=-94^\circ$, suggesting a predominantly Galactic origin for anisotropies at
these energies. The reconstructed dipole phases in the energy bins above 4 EeV
point instead to right ascensions that are almost opposite to the Galactic
center one, indicative of an extragalactic cosmic ray origin.

  half-metallicity of Co$_2$MnSi","  The electronic structure and half-metallic gap of Co$_{2}$MnSi in the
presence of crystallographic defects, partial Fe substitution for Mn, and
thermal spin fluctuations are studied using the coherent potential
approximation and the disordered local moment method. In the presence of 5\% Co
or Mn vacancies the Fermi level shifts down to the minority-spin valence-band
maximum. In contrast to NiMnSb, both types of Mn antisite defects in
Co$_{2}$MnSi are strongly exchange-coupled to the host magnetization, and
thermal spin fluctuations do not strongly affect the half-metallic gap. Partial
substitution of Mn by Fe results in considerable changes in the Bloch spectral
function near the Fermi level, which strongly deviate from the rigid-band
picture. In particular, a light band with the Fe character crosses the Fermi
level at about 50\% concentration. At room temperature, Fe substitution of up
to 30\% slightly increases the spin polarization at the Fermi level.

  orbits","  Recently, many orbital studies in barred galaxy potentials have revealed the
existence of orbits which are not trapped around x1 tree orbits, but could be
potentially appropriate building blocks for bars. These findings question the
uniqueness of the x1 family as the standard paradigm of orbital motion in
galactic bars. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the role that such
orbits could play in shaping the morphology of bars. We trace the morphological
patterns appearing in the face-on and edge-on views of the non-periodic orbits
presented in these studies and we show that they are introduced in the system
by second type bifurcations of x1. For this purpose, we use a typical 3D
Ferrers bar model and follow the radial and vertical bifurcations of the x1
family considered as being multi periodic, with multi = 2, 3, 5. The variation
of the stability indices of x1 in the multi = 2, 3 cases give us also the four-
and six- periodic orbits, respectively. We tabulate these orbits including all
information necessary to assess their role as appropriate building blocks. We
discuss their stability and their extent, as well as their size and
morphological evolution, as a function of energy. We conclude that even the
most important of the multi-periodic orbits presented in Tables 2 to 5 are less
appropriate building blocks for bars than the families of the x1 tree at the
same energy.

2002.06292v1,2020-02-15,2020-02-15,Disorder and magnetoconductivity in tilted Weyl semimetals,"  Gapless Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are a novel class of topological materials
that host massless Weyl fermions as their low-energy excitations. When the Weyl
cone is tilted, the Lorentz invariance is broken and the Lifshitz transition
drives the system from type-I WSMs into type-II WSMs. Here, based on the
lattice model, we perform a systematic numerical study of the effect of on-site
disorder on the diagonal magnetoconductivity in tilted WSMs.We use the
self-consistent Born approximation to calculate the disorder-induced
self-energy and then apply the Kubo-Streda formula to calculate the diagonal
magnetoconductivity. For the transverse magnetoconductivity \sigma_xx, the
disorder is found to exhibit distinct effects in the quantum limit regime and
in the quantum oscillation regime of type-I WSMs, which could be understood
from Einstein's relationship.With strong disorder, \sigma_xx shows a linear
relation with the inverse magnetic field 1/B , which exhibits certain
robustness to both the Fermi energy and the Weyl cone tilting. For the
longitudinal magnetoconductivity \sigma_zz , the strong disorder can break the
positive magnetoconductivity as well as the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.By
analyzing the spectral function, we find that the chiral anomaly is still
preserved at strong disorder even when the Weyl cone is overtilted, as there is
no gap opening around the Weyl nodes. The implications of our results for
experiments are discussed.

within a certain temperature window is always required to achieve
superconducting samples as reported by different groups around the world, but
the mechanism of annealing in inducing superconductivity has not been

the stoichiometry by depositing additional small amounts of Fe atoms. The
monolayer films become superconducting after the Fe deposition without any
annealing, and show similar superconducting transition temperatures as those of
the annealed films in transport measurements. We also demonstrate on the
5-unit-cell films that the FeSe multilayer can be reversibly tuned between the
non-superconducting $\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{5}$ phase with Fe-vacancies and
superconducting $1 \times 1$ phase. Our results reveal that the traditional
anneal process in essence removes Fe vacancies and the additional Fe deposition
serves as a more efficient way to achieve superconductivity. This work
highlights the significance of stoichiometry in the superconductivity of FeSe
thin films and provides an easy path for superconducting samples.

interest among the theoretical and experimental condensed matter community. The
two-dimensional second order topological insulators give rise to
zero-dimensional localized corner modes that reside within the band gap of the
system along with edge modes that inhabit a band edge next to bulk modes.
Thanks to the topological nature, information can be trapped at the corners of
these systems, which will be unhampered even in the presence of disorder. Being
localized at the corners, the exchange of information among the corner states
is an issue. Here we show that the nonlinearity in an exciton polariton system
can allow the coupling between the different corners through the edge states

connectible topological modes.

retrieve broadband transmission spectra of transiting exoplanets in order to
study their atmosphere. An alternative method has been proposed and has only
been used once to recover transmission spectra using chromatic

potentially imitate narrow and broadband features in the transmission spectra
retrieved from multiband photometric observations; however, there has been no
study regarding the influence of stellar activity on the retrieved transmission
spectra through chromatic Rossiter-McLaughlin. In this study with the modified
SOAP3.0 tool, we consider different types of stellar activity features (spots
and plages), and we generated a large number of realistic chromatic
Rossiter-McLaughlin curves for different types of planets and stars. We were
then able to retrieve their transmission spectra to evaluate the impact of
stellar activity on them. We find that chromatic Rossiter-McLaughlin
observations are also not immune to stellar activity, which can mimic broadband
features, such as Rayleigh scattering slope, in their retrieved transmission
spectra. We also find that the influence is independent of the planet radius,
orbital orientations, orbital period, and stellar rotation rate. However, more
general simulations demonstrate that the probability of mimicking strong
broadband features is lower than 25% and that can be mitigated by combining
several Rossiter-McLaughlin observations obtained during several transits.

reveal the origin of such high ordering temperature, critical behaviors,
electronic structure and crystal-field effects of Gd6FeBi2 are investigated in
this work. The short-range Gd-Fe ferrimagnetic interaction is supported by the
non-Curie-Weiss paramagnetic behavior, crystal and electronic structure
analyses, in agreement with previous DFT calculations. Unlike the strong TM-TM
exchange interactions, the Gd-Fe exchange interaction shows limited influence
on the critical exponents determined by long-range exchange interactions, which
seems a common feature in RE-TM based alloys without TM-TM exchange
interactions. However, the strong Gd-Fe hybridization reduces the influence of
vibronic couplings on the short-range exchange interaction and thus allows a
high Tc. The broadening or splitting mechanism of Gd 4f-electron bands is
addressed based on crystal-field analysis and likely another factor for
elevated Tc in Gd6FeBi2 and Gd-based compounds with non-magnetic elements.
Different magnetic behaviors among isostructural compounds, and the

requirement of a $5\sigma$ LOFAR detection allowed us to reduce the stellar
contamination in our sample by two orders of magnitude. The sample comprises
134 objects, including both photometrically selected candidate quasars (47) and
spectroscopically confirmed quasars (83). The depth of our LOFAR observations
allowed us to detect the radio-emission of quasars that would be otherwise
classified as radio-quiet. Around $65\%$ of the quasars in the sample are
fainter than $M_{\textrm{1450}}=-24.0$, a regime where the OLF of quasars
selected through their radio emission, has not been investigated in detail. It
has been demonstrated that in cases where mid-ir wedge-based AGN selection is
not possible due to a lack of appropriate data, the selection of quasars using
ML algorithms trained with optical/mid-ir photometry in combination with LOFAR
data provides an excellent approach for obtaining samples of quasars. We
demonstrate that RSQs show an evolution similar to that exhibited by faint
quasars $(M_{\textrm{1450}}\leq-22.0)$. Finally, we find that RSQs may compose
up to $\sim20\%$ of the whole faint quasar population (radio-detected plus
radio-undetected).

universe. This horizon gives rise to additional terms in the equations of
motion. Using dynamical system calculations, our results show that in the
presence of dark energy for certain conditions, the last attractor of this
theory will be dark energy epoch, but in the absence of dark energy, entropic
force energy portion will have the lead role in the late time universe and is
responsible for accelerated expansion of that. Interestingly, assuming both
entropic force terms and dark energy to have their share of energy density of
the universe, we have found that, in certain conditions entropic force
dominated epoch is a stable fixed point while the dark energy epoch is a saddle
point.

several interesting new physics questions associated with detecting as well as
understanding interactions and astrophysical effects of muonphilic dark matter
particles. The key model inputs for studying the latter are the total muon mass
$M_{\mu}$, the muon mass fraction $M_{\mu}/M_{\rm NS}$ over the NS mass $M_{\rm
NS}$ and the muon radial density profile $\rho_{\mu}(r)$ in NSs of varying
masses. We investigate these quantities within a minimum model for the core of
NSs consisting of neutrons, protons, electrons, and muons using an explicitly
isospin-dependent parametric Equation of State (EOS) constrained by available
nuclear laboratory experiments and the latest astrophysical observations of NS
masses, radii and tidal deformabilities. We found that the absolutely maximum
muon mass $M_{\mu}$ and its mass fraction $M_{\mu}/M_{\rm NS}$ in the most
massive NSs allowed by causality are about 0.025 $M_\odot$ and 1.1\%,
respectively. For the most massive NS of mass 2.14 $M_\odot$ observed so far,
they reduce to about 0.020 $M_\odot$ and 0.9\%, respectively. We also study
respective effects of individual parameters describing the EOS of high-density
neutron-rich nucleonic matter on the muon contents in NSs with varying masses.
We found that the most important but uncertain nuclear physics ingredient for
determining the muon contents in NSs is the high-density nuclear symmetry
energy.

to develop exposure guidelines/standards for human safety as well as product
safety assessment. At frequencies from a few hundred Hz to 10 MHz, the adverse
effect to be protected is the stimulation of the peripheral nervous system. The
in situ electric field in the skin is used as a surrogate of nerve activation.
In the low-frequency dosimetry, a high but inaccurate in situ electric field
has been reported at positions where a skin-to-skin contact exists, whose
relation to the stimulation is controversial. One of the reasons for high
electric fields may be attributable to the current resolution of anatomical
models. In this study, we first evaluate the stimulation threshold at postures
of skin-to-skin contact experimentally for different hand/finger positions to
represent skin touching/non-touching scenarios. We confirm that the
skin-to-skin contact does not lower the threshold current of magnetic
stimulation devices needed to induce pain. Second, a new method is proposed for
hand modeling to configure different finger positions using static hand models
with similar postures to the experiments. We compute the in situ electric field
at skin-to-skin contact for the different hand posture scenarios that indicate
an excessive raise of the electric field in skin-to-skin regions that is not
justified by the experiments. The comparison suggests that a high in situ
electric field in the skin would be caused by poor modeling of the skin layers,
which is not enough to represent in a resolution of the order of a millimeter.
This skin-to-skin contact should not be considered to set the restriction in
the international exposure guidelines/standards as well as product safety
assessment.

rates, are obtained via asteroseismic observations. A comparison of core
rotation rates found in this way with core rotation rates as predicted by
stellar evolution models demonstrate a large discrepancy. This means that there
must be a process of angular momentum transport missing in the current theory
of stellar evolution. A new formalism was recently proposed to fill in for this
missing process, which has the Tayler instability as its starting point
(hereafter referred to as `Fuller-formalism'). Aims: We investigate the effect
of the Fuller-formalism on the internal rotation of stellar models with an
initial mass of 2.5 Mo. Methods: Stellar evolution models, including the
Fuller-formalism, of intermediate-mass stars were calculated to make a
comparison between asteroseismically obtained core rotation rates in the core
He burning phase and in the white dwarf phase. Results: Our main results show
that models including the Fuller-formalism can match the core rotation rates
obtained for the core He burning phases. However, these models are unable to
match the rotation rates obtained for white dwarfs. When we exclude the
Fuller-formalism at the end of the core He burning phase, the white dwarf
rotation rates of the models match the observed rates. Conclusions: We conclude
that in the present form, the Fuller-formalism cannot be the sole solution for
the missing process of angular momentum transport in intermediate-mass stars.

make it a special case amongst the unconventional superconductors. A
consequence of this symmetry is the possible existence of superconducting
domains of opposite chirality. At the boundary of such domains, the locally
supressed condensate can produce an intrinsic Josephson junction. Here, we
provide evidence of such junctions using mesoscopic rings, structured from
Sr$_\mathsf{2}$RuO$_\mathsf{4}$ single crystals. Our order parameter
simulations predict such rings to host stable domain walls across their arms.
Thisis verified with transport experiments on loops, with a sharp transition at
1.5 K, which show distinct critical current oscillations with periodicity
corresponding to the flux quantum. In contrast, loops with broadened
transitions at around 3 K are void of such junctions and show standard
Little-Parks oscillations. Our analysis demonstrates the junctions are of
intrinsic origin and makes a compelling case for the existence of
superconducting domains.

15, 18--24 (2019)] and compare their performance to the conventional EOM-CCSD
approach and to the completely renormalized EOM-CCSD with perturbative triples

static/nondynamic electron correlation, while dynamical electron correlation is
accounted for \textit{a posteriori}, the investigated pCCD-based methods
represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost. Such a
feature is particularly advantageous when modelling electronic structures of

EOM-pCCD-based methods reliably predict electronic spectra of small actinide

the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey of a sample (38) of high-mass YSOs. The
water maser positions and three-dimensional (3D) velocities were determined
through Very Long Baseline Array observations with accuracies of a few
milliarcsec (mas) and a few km/s, respectively. The position of the ionized
core of the protostellar wind, marking the YSO, was determined through
sensitive continuum Jansky Very Large Array observations with a typical error
of 20 mas. The statistic of the separation of the water masers from the radio
continuum shows that 84% of the masers are found within 1000 au from the YSO
and 45% of them are within 200 au. Therefore, we can conclude that the 22 GHz
water masers are a reliable proxy for the YSO position. The distribution of
maser luminosity is strongly peaked towards low values, indicating that about
half of the maser population is still undetected with the current Very Long
Baseline Interferometry detection thresholds of 50-100 mJy/beam.
Next-generation, sensitive radio interferometers will exploit these weak masers
for an improved sampling of the velocity and magnetic fields around the YSOs.
The average direction of the water maser proper motions provides a
statistically-significant estimate for the orientation of the jet emitted by
the YSO: 55% of the maser proper motions are directed on the sky within an
angle of 30 deg from the jet axis. Finally, we show that our measurements of 3D
maser velocities statistically support models in which water maser emission
arises from planar shocks with propagation direction close to the plane of the
sky.

the reference Pareto-optimal front is generated to validate the Pareto front
obtained using CPSMOEA; in the second step, integrated decision-making by
combining fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) with grey relation projection method
(GRP) aims to extract the best compromise solutions which reflect the
preferences of decision-makers from the POSs. Based on the test results on the
IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems, it is demonstrated that the proposed
approach not only manages to address the MORPD issue but also outperforms other
commonly-used MOO algorithms including multi-objective particle swarm

the third evolution step of generalized differential evolution (GDE3).

We found that the transition temperature of the system decreased as the

were less and value of $\nu$ more than the corresponding zero disorder values.
The use of large system sizes led to the correct variation of critical

low-mass protostars as well as molecular clouds, suggesting that these
interstellar species originate from the early stage(s) of starformation. The
reaction pathways resulting in COMs described by the formula C$_2$H$_\text{n}$O
are still under debate. In this work, we investigate the laboratory possible
solid-state reactions that involve simple hydrocarbons and OH-radicals along
with H$_2$O ice under translucent cloud conditions (1$\leq$A$_V$$\leq$5 and
\textit{n}$_\text{H}$$\sim$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$). We focus on the interactions of
C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals, which are produced along the H$_2$O
formation sequence on grain surfaces at 10 K. Ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
experiments were performed to study the surface chemistry observed during
C$_2$H$_2$ + O$_2$ + H codeposition, where O$_2$ was used for the in-situ
generation of OH-radicals. Reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)
was applied to in situ monitor the initial and newly formed species. After
that, a temperature-programmed desorption experiment combined with a Quadrupole
mass spectrometer (TPD-QMS) was used as a complementary analytical tool. The
investigated 10 K surface chemistry of C$_2$H$_2$ with H-atoms and OH-radicals
not only results in semi and fully saturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene
(C$_2$H$_4$) and ethane (C$_2$H$_6$), but it also leads to the formation of
COMs, such as vinyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, ketene, ethanol, and possibly acetic
acid. It is concluded that OH-radical addition reactions to C$_2$H$_2$, acting
as a molecular backbone, followed by isomerization (i.e., keto-enol
tautomerization) via an intermolecular pathway and successive hydrogenation
provides a so far experimentally unreported solid-state route for the formation
of these species without the need of energetic input.

  blob toward the L1521F VeLLO system","  The SOLIS (Seeds Of Life In Space) IRAM/NOEMA Large Program aims at studying
a set of crucial complex organic molecules in a sample of sources, with
well-known physical structure, covering the various phases of Solar-type star
formation. One representative object of the transition from the prestellar core
to the protostar phases has been observed toward the Very Low Luminosity Object
(VeLLO) called L1521F. This type of source is important to study to make the
link between prestellar cores and Class 0 sources and also to constrain the
chemical evolution during the process of star formation. Two frequency windows
(81.6-82.6 GHz and 96.65-97.65 GHz) were used to observe the emission from
several complex organics toward the L1521F VeLLO. Only 2 transitions of
methanol (A+, E2) have been detected in the narrow window centered at 96.7 GHz
(with an upper limit on E1) in a very compact emission blob (~7'' corresponding
to ~1000au) toward the NE of the L1521F protostar. The CS 2-1 transition is
also detected within the WideX bandwidth. Consistently, with what has been
found in prestellar cores, the methanol emission appears ~1000au away from the
dust peak. The location of the methanol blob coincides with one of the
filaments previously reported in the literature. The Tex of the gas inferred
from methanol is (10$\pm$2) K, while the H2 gas density (estimated from the
detected CS 2-1 emission and previous CS 5-4 ALMA obs.) is a factor >25 higher
than the density in the surrounding environment (n(H2) >10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$).
From its compactness, low excitation temperature and high gas density, we
suggest that the methanol emission detected with NOEMA is either a cold and
dense shock-induced blob, recently formed ($\leq$ few hundred years) by
infalling gas or a cold and dense fragment that may have just been formed as a
result of the intense gas dynamics found within the L1521F VeLLO system.

high-entropy alloys (HEAs), proposed as new high-temperature material, is
required for improving their typically insufficient room-temperature ductility.
Here, density-functional theory simulations and a continuum mechanics analysis
were conducted to systematically investigate the competition between cleavage
decohesion and dislocation emission from a crack tip in the body-centered cubic
refractory HEAs HfNbTiZr, MoNbTaVW, MoNbTaW, MoNbTiV, and NbTiVZr. This
crack-tip competition is evaluated for tensile loading and a totality of 15
crack configurations and slip systems. Our results predict that dislocation
plasticity at the crack tip is generally unfavorable -- although the
competition is close for some crack orientations, suggesting intrinsic
brittleness and low crack-tip fracture toughness in these five HEAs at zero
temperature. Fluctuations in local alloy composition, investigated for
HfNbTiZr, can locally reduce the resistance to dislocation emission for a slip
system relative to the configuration average of that slip system, but do not
change the dominant crack-tip response. In the case of single-crystal MoNbTaW,
where an experimental, room-temperature fracture-toughness value is available
for a crack on a \{100\} plane, theoretical and experimental results agree
favorably. Factors that may limit the agreement are discussed. We survey the
effect of material anisotropy on preferred crack tip orientations, which are
found to be alloy specific. Mixed-mode loadings are found to shift the
competition in favor of cleavage or dislocation nucleation, depending on crack
configuration and amplified by the effect of material anisotropy on crack tip
stresses.

2002.07113v1,2020-02-17,2020-02-17,Handling Missing Annotations in Supervised Learning Data,"  Data annotation is an essential stage in supervised learning. However, the
annotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large
datasets. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an example of systems
that exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor
readings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The
size of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a
human annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the
dataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting
supervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is
negatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate
three different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps
are taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single ""Unknown"" or
""Do-Nothing"" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of
the second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one
of them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels.
Also, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by
constructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further
performance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and
their hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing
more than $2.5\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more
than nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast
under the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling
approach for better performance.

  instability in protoplanetary disks","  The streaming instability is a leading candidate mechanism to explain the
formation of planetesimals. Yet, the role of this instability in the driving of
turbulence in protoplanetary disks, given its fundamental nature as a linear
hydrodynamical instability, has so far not been investigated in detail. We
study the turbulence that is induced by the streaming instability as well as
its interaction with the vertical shear instability. For this purpose, we
employ the FLASH Code to conduct two-dimensional axisymmetric global disk
simulations spanning radii from $1$ au to $100$ au, including the mutual drag
between gas and dust as well as the radial and vertical stellar gravity. If the
streaming instability and the vertical shear instability start their growth at
the same time, we find the turbulence in the dust mid-plane layer to be
primarily driven by the streaming instability. It gives rise to vertical gas
motions with a Mach number of up to ${\sim}10^{-2}$. The dust scale height is
set in a self-regulatory manner to about $1\%$ of the gas scale height. In
contrast, if the vertical shear instability is allowed to saturate before the
dust is introduced into our simulations, then it continues to be the main
source of the turbulence in the dust layer. The vertical shear instability
induces turbulence with a Mach number of ${\sim}10^{-1}$ and thus impedes dust
sedimentation. Nonetheless, we find the vertical shear instability and the
streaming instability in combination to lead to radial dust concentration in
long-lived accumulations which are significantly denser than those formed by
the streaming instability alone. Thus, the vertical shear instability may
promote planetesimal formation by creating weak overdensities that act as seeds
for the streaming instability.

the empirical upper luminosity limit of red supergiants, the Humphrey-Davidson
(HD) limit at high and low metallicity. In this study, we provide a better
understanding of what drives massive star evolution to blue and red supergiant
phases, with the ultimate aim of reproducing the HD limit at varied
metallicities (Z). For solar, LMC, and SMC Z, we develop eight grids of MESA
models for the mass range 20-60M to probe the effect of semiconvection and
overshooting. We compare rotating and non-rotating models with efficient
(alpha_semi = 100) and inefficient semi-convection (alpha_semi = 0.1), with
high and low core overshooting (alpha_ov of 0.1 or 0.5). The red and blue
supergiant evolutionary phases are investigated by comparing the fraction of
core He-burning lifetimes spent in each phase. We find that the extension of
the convective core by overshooting alpha_ov = 0.5 has an effect on the post-MS
evolution which can disable semiconvection leading to more RSGs, but a lack of
BSGs. We therefore implement alpha_ov = 0.1 which switches on semiconvective
mixing, though for standard alpha_semi = 1, would result in an HD limit which
is higher than observed at low Z. Therefore, we need to implement very
efficient semiconvection of alpha_semi = 100 which reproduces the HD limit at
log L ~ 5.5 for the Magellanic Clouds while simultaneously reproducing the
Galactic HD limit of log L ~ 5.8 naturally. The effect of semiconvection is not
active at high Z due to the depletion of the envelope structure by strong mass
loss such that semiconvective regions could not form. Z-dependent mass loss
plays an indirect, yet decisive role in setting the HD limit as a function of
Z. For a combination of efficient semiconvection and low overshooting with
standard Z-dependent mass loss, we find a natural HD limit at all
metallicities.

of solutions with the help of conserved quantities are reported. It is shown
that different scenarios of cosmic evolution can be discussed using Noether

  Testing of Industrial Embedded Software Applications","  Hyper-heuristic is a new methodology for the adaptive hybridization of
meta-heuristic algorithms to derive a general algorithm for solving
optimization problems. This work focuses on the selection type of
hyper-heuristic, called the Exponential Monte Carlo with Counter (EMCQ).
Current implementations rely on the memory-less selection that can be
counterproductive as the selected search operator may not (historically) be the
best performing operator for the current search instance. Addressing this
issue, we propose to integrate the memory into EMCQ for combinatorial t-wise
test suite generation using reinforcement learning based on the Q-learning
mechanism, called Q-EMCQ. The limited application of combinatorial test
generation on industrial programs can impact the use of such techniques as
Q-EMCQ. Thus, there is a need to evaluate this kind of approach against
relevant industrial software, with a purpose to show the degree of interaction
required to cover the code as well as finding faults. We applied Q-EMCQ on 37
real-world industrial programs written in Function Block Diagram (FBD)
language, which is used for developing a train control management system at
Bombardier Transportation Sweden AB. The results of this study show that Q-EMCQ
is an efficient technique for test case generation. Additionally, unlike the
t-wise test suite generation, which deals with the minimization problem, we
have also subjected Q-EMCQ to a maximization problem involving the general
module clustering to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

  improved exoplanet detection. I. Case of regularly sampled radial velocity
  observations","  Convective motions at the stellar surface generate a stochastic colored noise
source in the radial velocity (RV) data. This noise impedes the detection of
small exoplanets. Moreover, the unknown statistics (amplitude, distribution)
related to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false alarm probability
(FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar
convection to design detection methods that can provide both a reliable
estimate of the FAP and a high detection power. We tested the realism of 3D
simulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk
integrated velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO
spacecraft. We presented a new detection method based on periodograms
standardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection tests
to these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D
synthetic convective noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short
periods. For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP
derived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized
by 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work
(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer
better detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest
periodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with
eccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable
synthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series
can be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP

is depressed compared to the quiet Sun. This so-called Wilson depression is
caused by the Lorentz force of the strong magnetic field inside the spots.
However, it is not understood in detail yet, how the Wilson depression is
related to the strength and geometry of the magnetic field or to other
properties of the sunspot.
  Aims: We aim to study the dependence of the Wilson depression on the
properties of the magnetic field of the sunspots and how exactly the magnetic
field contributes to balancing the Wilson depression with respect to the gas
pressure of the surroundings of the spots.
  Methods: Our study is based on 24 spectropolarimetric scans of 12 individual
sunspots performed with Hinode. We derived the Wilson depression for each spot
using both, a recently developed method that is based on minimizing the
divergence of the magnetic field, and an approach developed earlier that
enforces an equilibrium between the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure
inside the spot and the gas pressure in the quiet Sun, thus neglecting the
influence of the curvature force. We then performed a statistical analysis by
comparing the Wilson depression resulting from the two techniques with each
other and by relating them to various parameters of the sunspots, such as their
size or the strength of the magnetic field.
  Results: We find that the Wilson depression becomes larger for spots with a
stronger magnetic field, but not as much as one would expect from the increased
magnetic pressure. This suggests that the curvature integral provides an
important contribution to the Wilson depression, particularly for spots with a
weak magnetic field. Our results indicate that the geometry of the magnetic
field in the penumbra is different between spots with different strengths of
the average umbral magnetic field.

  Paxos","  Fault-tolerant distributed systems offer high reliability because even if
faults in their components occur, they do not exhibit erroneous behavior.
Depending on the fault model adopted, hardware and software errors that do not
result in a process crashing are usually not tolerated. To tolerate these
rather common failures the usual solution is to adopt a stronger fault model,
such as the arbitrary or Byzantine fault model. Algorithms created for this
fault model, however, are considerably more complex and require more system
resources than the ones developed for less strict fault models. One approach to
reach a middle ground is the non-malicious arbitrary fault model. This model
assumes it is possible to detect and filter faults with a given probability, if
these faults are not created with malicious intent, allowing the isolation and
mapping of these faults to benign faults. In this paper we describe how we
incremented an implementation of active replication in the non-malicious fault
model with a basic type of distributed validation, where a deviation from the
expected algorithm behavior will make a process crash. We experimentally
evaluate this implementation using a fault injection framework showing that it
is feasible to extend the concept of non-malicious failures beyond hardware
failures.

state stored in stable memory to guarantee the irreversibility of operations
even in the presence of failures. The performance of these algorithms lean
heavily on the performance of stable memory. Current storage technologies have
a defined performance profile: data is accessed in blocks of hundreds or
thousands of bytes, random access to these blocks is expensive and sequential
access is somewhat better. File system implementations hide some of the
performance limitations of the underlying storage devices using buffers and
caches. However, fail-recovery distributed algorithms bypass some of these
techniques and perform synchronous writes to be able to tolerate a failure
during the write itself. Assuming the distributed system designer is able to
buffer the algorithm's writes, we ask how buffer size and latency complement
each other. In this paper we start to answer this question by characterizing
the performance (throughput and latency) of typical stable memory devices using
a representative set of current file systems.

abyssal hilly plains is important to quantify processes for the modelling of
resuspension and dispersal of sediments in areas where turbulence sources are
expected to be relatively weak. Turbulence may disperse sediments from
artificial deep-sea mining activities over large distances. To quantify
turbulent mixing above the deep-ocean floor around 4000 m depth,
high-resolution moored temperature sensor observations have been obtained from
the near-equatorial southeast Pacific (7{\deg}S, 88{\deg}W). Models demonstrate
low activity of equatorial flow dynamics, internal tides and surface
near-inertial motions in the area. The present observations demonstrate a
Conservative Temperature difference of about 0.012{\deg}C between 7 and 406
meter above the bottom (hereafter, mab, for short), which is a quarter of the
adiabatic lapse rate. The very weakly stratified waters with buoyancy periods
between about six hours and one day allow for slowly varying mixing. The
calculated turbulence dissipation rate values are half to one order of
magnitude larger than those from open-ocean turbulent exchange well away from
bottom topography and surface boundaries. In the deep, turbulent overturns
extend up to 100 m tall, in the ocean-interior, and also reach the lowest
sensor. The overturns are governed by internal-wave-shear and -convection. The
turbulence inertial subrange is observed to extend into the internal wave
frequency band. The associated mixing is not related to bottom friction
processes but to internal wave breaking and near-inertial shear. The mixing
facilitates long (hours to day) and high (exceeding 100 mab) dispersal of
suspended sediments.

reveal where the $\alpha$ is different for binary black hole (BBH) and NSBH
systems. In the absence of a low mass gap, the gravitational wave data as well
as the electromagnetic data can be used to pin down the nature of the merger
event and then measure the mass of these very light black holes. However, as a
result of the misclassification of BBH into NSBH, the measurement of $\alpha$

small by a factor of order 1.5, which can plausibly be explained by a
combination of a slightly overestimated dielectric constant and omitted third-

by a Lindblad master equation. Dissipation typically drives the system to the
maximally mixed state; consequently, there generally exists an optimal
evolution time beyond which the decoherence prevents the system from getting
closer to the target state. For some specific dissipation channel, however, the
optimal control can keep the system from the maximum entropy state for
infinitely long. The conditions under which this specific situation arises are
discussed in detail. The numerical procedure to construct the time-optimal
protocol is described. In particular, the formalism adopted here can
efficiently evaluate the time-dependent singular control which turns out to be

2002.07669v1,2020-02-18,2020-02-18,Electron Beams Cannot Directly Produce Coronal Rain,"  Coronal rain is ubiquitous in flare loops, forming shortly after the onset of
the solar flare. Rain is thought to be caused by a thermal instability, a
localized runaway cooling of material in the corona. The models that
demonstrate this require extremely long duration heating on the order of the
radiative cooling time, localized near the footpoints of the loops. In flares,
electron beams are thought to be the primary energy transport mechanism,
driving strong footpoint heating during the impulsive phase that causes
evaporation, filling and heating flare loops. Electron beams, however, do not
act for a long period of time, and even supposing that they did, their heating
would not remain localized at the footpoints. With a series of numerical
experiments, we show directly that these two issues mean that electron beams
are incapable of causing the formation of rain in flare loops. This result
suggests that either there is another mechanism acting in flare loops
responsible for rain, or that the modeling of the cooling of flare loops is
somehow deficient. To adequately describe flares, the standard model must
address this issue to account for the presence of coronal rain.

We combine the radial-velocity measurements of CORALIE and HARPS taken over two

estimate. From the SPHERE data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the
companion from Y to J band, as well as photometric measurements from IRDIS in

H-band contrast of $10.61\pm0.16$ mag and, using the age estimate of the star
to be $\sim$1 Gyr, gives an isochronal mass estimate of $\sim$44

obtain a dynamical mass of $50.5^{+3.3}_{-3.5} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. Through

long as the cosmological ones, and down to atoms and molecules and the very
small nuclear size. They also appear in several other scenarios, in particular
in biological systems as in ants, bees, birds, fishes, gnus and rats, for
instance. Here we describe a model composed of a set of female and male
individuals that obeys simple rules that rapidly transform an uniform initial
state into a single cluster that evolves in time as a stable dynamical
structure. We show that the center of mass of the structure moves as a random
walk, and that the size of the cluster engenders a power law behavior in terms
of the number of individuals in the system. Moreover, we also examine other
possibilities, in particular the case of two distinct species that can evolve
to form one or two distinct clusters.

quasiparticles in half-Heusler topological semimetals in quasi-two-dimensional

generalized Heisenberg coupling of the form ${\cal H}_{\rm RKKY} \propto
{\sigma}_{1,i} {\cal I}_{ij} {\sigma}_{2,j}$ with a symmetric matrix ${\cal
I}_{ij}$, addition of small antisymmetric linear spin-orbit coupling term leads
to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling with an antisymmetric matrix ${\cal
I}'_{ij}$. We demonstrate that besides the oscillatory dependence on the
distance, all coupling strengths strongly depend on the relative orientation of
the two impurities with respect to the lattice. This yields a strongly
anisotropic behavior for ${\cal I}_{ij}$ such that by only rotating one
impurity around another at a constant distance, we can see further oscillations
of the RKKY couplings. This unprecedented effect is unique to our system which
combines spin-orbit coupling with strongly anisotropic Fermi surfaces. We
further find that all of the RKKY terms have two common features: a tetragonal
warping in their map of spatial variations, and a complex beating pattern.
Intriguingly, all these features survive in all dopings and we see them in both
electron- and hole-doped cases. In addition, due to the lower dimensionality
combined with the effects of different spin-orbit couplings, we see that only
one symmetric off-diagonal term, ${\cal I}_{xy}$ and two DM components ${\cal
I}'_{xz}$ and ${\cal I}'_{yz}$ are nonvanishing, while the remaining three
off-diagonal components are identically zero. This manifests another drastic
difference of RKKY interaction in half-Heusler topological semimetals compared

general interactions with up to second derivatives of the scalar field whose

corresponding to 8 distinct types -- only one of which corresponds to known

for eliminating the Ostrogradsky ghost in a covariant theory at the level of
the quadratic action in unitary gauge. Novel implications of the degenerate
higher-order system for the Cauchy problem are illustrated with the phase space
portrait of an explicit inflationary example: not all field configurations lead
to physical solutions for the metric even for positive potentials; solutions
are unique for a given configuration only up to a branch choice; solutions on
one branch can apparently end at nonsingular points of the metric and their
continuation on alternate branches lead to nonsingular bouncing solutions;
unitary gauge perturbations can go unstable even when degenerate terms in the
Lagrangian are infinitesimal. The attractor solution leads to an inflationary
scenario where slow-roll parameters vary and running of the tilt can be large
even with no explicit features in the potential far from the end of inflation,
requiring the optimized slow-roll approach for predicting observables.

kept at different temperatures in the case when the dielectric permittivity of

permittivity at two different temperatures as the permittivities of two
dissimilar bodies, thus allowing to apply the theory of Casimir forces out of
thermal equilibrium developed earlier in the literature. Following this
approach, we show that, in addition to the equilibrium contribution to the
nonequilibrium Casimir pressure, a proper nonequilibrium contribution arises
for temperature-dependent dielectric permittivities. Furthermore, the
equilibrium contribution in this case does not equal the mean of the
equilibrium Casimir pressures at the temperatures of the plates. As an
application, the total nonequilibrium Casimir pressure between two gold plates
and between two titanium plates is calculated as a function of the plate
thickness and their separation, using the Drude and the plasma model. For plate
separations ranging from 0.5 to 2 micrometers, the relative difference between
the theoretical predictions for these two models reaches 39%. The proper
nonequilibrium term may be as large as 4% of the magnitude of the total

2002.08077v1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,The role of disc torques in forming resonant planetary systems,"  The most accurate method for modelling planetary migration and hence the
formation of resonant systems is using hydrodynamical simulations. Usually, the
force (torque) acting on a planet is calculated using the forces from the gas
disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed using the pressure
gradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For the
non-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque
calculation while for the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to study
how much this inconsistent torque calculation can affect the final
configuration of a two-planet system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets
because most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey,
have masses around 10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of
planet-disc interaction, we measure the torques on non-migrating and migrating
planets for various disc masses as well as density and temperature slopes with
and without considering the disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find a
relation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it in an N-body code, and
perform an extended parameter study modelling the migration of a planetary
system with different planet mass ratios and disc surface densities, in order
to investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of
the planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an
artificially larger torque on the migrating planet that can result in tighter
planetary systems. The deviation of this torque from the correct value is
larger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical
modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque
correction, otherwise the results favour more packed systems.

spectral class L. The event was identified in the EXTraS database of XMM-Newton
variable sources, and its optical counterpart, J0331-27, was found through a
cross-match with the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 release. Next to an earlier
four-photon detection of Kelu-1, J0331-27 is only the second L dwarf detected
in X-rays, and much more distant than other ultracool dwarfs with X-ray
detections (photometric distance of 240 pc). From an optical spectrum with the
VIMOS instrument at the VLT, we determine the spectral type of J0331-27 to be
L1. The X-ray flare has an energy of E_X,F ~ 2x10^33 erg, placing it in the
regime of superflares. No quiescent emission is detected, and from 2.5 Msec of
XMM data we derive an upper limit of L_X,qui < 10^27 erg/s. The flare peak
luminosity L_X,peak = 6.3x10^29 erg/s, flare duration tau_decay ~ 2400 s, and
plasma temperature (~16 MK) are similar to values observed in X-ray flares of M
dwarfs. This shows that strong magnetic reconnection events and the ensuing
plasma heating are still present even in objects with photospheres as cool as
~2100 K. However, the absence of any other flares above the detection threshold
of E_X,F ~2.5x10^32 erg in a total of ~2.5 Ms of X-ray data yields a flare
energy number distribution inconsistent with the canonical power law dN/dE ~
E^-2, suggesting that magnetic energy release in J0331-27 -- and possibly in
all L dwarfs -- takes place predominantly in the form of giant flares.

magnetic data storage and transfer applications, which require forming FM
nano-structures embedded in non-ferromagnetic matrices. Here, we investigate
the possiblity of creating such nano-structures by ion-irradiation. We study
the effect of lateral confinement on the ion-irradiation-induced reduction of
non-magnetic metal oxides (e.g., antiferro- or paramagnetic) to form
ferromagnetic metals. Our findings are later exploited to form 3-dimensional
magnetic interfaces between Co, CoO and Pt by spatially-selective irradiation
of CoO/Pt multilayers. We demonstrate that the mechanical displacement of the O
atoms plays a crucial role during the reduction from insulating,
non-ferromagnetic cobalt oxides to metallic cobalt. Metallic cobalt yields both
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the generated Co/Pt nano-structures, and,
at low temperatures, exchange bias at vertical interfaces between Co and CoO.
If pushed to the limit of ion-irradiation technology, this approach could, in
principle, enable the creation of densely-packed, atomic scale ferromagnetic

The basic idea in the simplest case is that the transient non-equilibrium

parallel to the initial state, while the orthogonal component appears as
equilibrated right from the beginning. The main emphasis is laid on the largely
unexplored and particularly challenging case that one energy level exhibits a

  bitrinsic stars","  S stars are late-type giants with overabundances of s-process elements. They
come in two flavours depending on the presence or not of technetium (Tc), an
element without stable isotopes. Intrinsic S stars are Tc-rich and genuine
asymptotic giant branch (AGB)stars while extrinsic S stars owe their s-process
overabundances to the pollution from a former AGB companion, now a white
dwarf(WD). In addition to Tc, another distinctive feature between intrinsic and
extrinsic S stars is the overabundance of niobium (Nb) in the latter class. We
discuss the case of the S stars BD+79 156 and o1Ori whose specificity is to
share the distinctive features of both intrinsic and extrinsic S stars, namely
the presence of Tc along with a Nb overabundance. BD+79 156 is the first clear
case of a bitrinsic star, i.e. a doubly s-process-enriched object, first
through mass transfer in a binary system, and then through internal
nucleosynthesis (responsible for the Tc-enrichment in BD+79 156 which must
therefore have reached the AGB phase of its evolution). This hybrid nature of
the s-process pattern in BD+79 156 is supported by its binary nature and its
location in the HR diagram just beyond the onset of the third dredge-up on the
AGB. The Tc-rich, binary S-star o1Ori with a WD companion was another
long-standing candidate for a similar hybrid s-process enrichment. However the
marginal overabundance of Nb derived ino1Ori does not allow to trace
unambiguously the evidence of a large pollution coming from the AGB progenitor

2002.08262v1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,"Characterizing the spatial pattern of solar supergranulation using the
  bispectrum","  Context. The spatial power spectrum of supergranulation does not fully
characterize the underlying physics of turbulent convection. For example, it
does not describe the non-Gaussianity in the horizontal flow divergence.
  Aims. Our aim is to statistically characterize the spatial pattern of solar
supergranulation beyond the power spectrum. The next-order statistic is the
bispectrum. It measures correlations of three Fourier components and is related
to the nonlinearities in the underlying physics.
  Methods. We estimated the bispectrum of supergranular horizontal surface
divergence maps that were obtained using local correlation tracking (LCT) and
time-distance helioseismology (TD) from one year of data from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory starting in May
2010.
  Results. We find significantly nonzero and consistent estimates for the
bispectrum. The strongest nonlinearity is present when the three coupling wave
vectors are at the supergranular scale. These are the same wave vectors that
are present in regular hexagons, which were used in analytical studies of solar
convection. At these Fourier components, the bispectrum is positive, consistent
with the positive skewness in the data and with supergranules preferentially
consisting of outflows surrounded by a network of inflows. We use the
bispectrum to generate synthetic divergence maps that are very similar to the
data by a model that consists of a Gaussian term and a weaker quadratic
nonlinear component. Thereby, we estimate the fraction of the variance in the
divergence maps from the nonlinear component to be of the order of 4-6%.
  Conclusions. We propose that bispectral analysis is useful for understanding
solar turbulent convection, for example for comparing observations and
numerical models of supergranular flows. This analysis may also be useful to
generate synthetic flow fields.

  WASP-52b using ESPRESSO","  WASP-52b is a low density hot Jupiter orbiting a moderately active K2V star.
Previous low-resolution studies have revealed a cloudy atmosphere and found
atomic Na above the cloud deck. Here we report the detection of excess
absorption at the Na doublet, the H$\alpha$ line, and the K D$_1$ line. We
derived a high-resolution transmission spectrum based on three transits of
WASP-52b, observed with the ultra stable, high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO
at the VLT. We measure a line contrast of $1.09\pm 0.16$% for Na D$_1$,
$1.31\pm 0.13$% for Na D$_2$, $0.86\pm 0.13$% for H$\alpha$, and $0.46\pm
0.13$% for K D$_1$, with a line FWHM range of 11-22 km s$^{-1}$. We also find
that the velocity shift of these detected lines during the transit is
consistent with the planet orbital motion, thus confirming their planetary
origin. We do not observe any significant net blueshift or redshift that can be
attributed to planetary winds. We use activity indicator lines as control but
find no excess absorption. However, we do notice signatures arising from the
Center-to-Limb variation (CLV) and the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect at these
control lines. This highlights the importance of the CLV+RM correction in
correctly deriving the transmission spectrum, which, if not corrected, could
resemble or cancel out planetary absorption in certain cases. WASP-52b is the
second non-ultra-hot Jupiter to show excess H$\alpha$ absorption, after HD
189733b. Future observations targeting non-ultra-hot Jupiters that show
H$\alpha$ could help reveal the relation between stellar activity and the
heating processes in the planetary upper atmosphere.

algorithms to demonstrate its ability to optimize problems comparing to the
others. The results of the algorithm from the works that utilized the DA in the
literature and the results of the benchmark functions showed that in comparison
with some other algorithms DA has an excellent performance, especially for

2002.08462v1,2020-02-19,2020-02-19,"Inter-numerology Interference Management with Adaptive Guards: A
  Cross-layer Approach","  The next-generation communication technologies are evolving towards increased
flexibility in various aspects. Although orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) remains as the waveform of the upcoming fifth-generation
(5G) standard, the new radio provides flexibility in waveform parametrization
(a.k.a. numerology) to address diverse requirements. However, managing the
peaceful coexistence of mixed numerologies is challenging due to
inter-numerology interference (INI). This paper proposes the utilization of
adaptive guards in both time and frequency domains as a solution along with a
multi-window operation in the physical (PHY) layer. The adaptive windowing
operation needs a guard duration to reduce the unwanted emissions, and a guard
band is required to handle the INI level on the adjacent band. The guards in
both domains are jointly optimized with respect to the subcarrier spacing, use
case (i.e., service requirement), and power offset between the numerologies.
Also, the multi-window approach provides managing each side of the spectrum
independently in case of an asymmetric interference scenario. Since the allowed
interference level depends on the numerologies operating in the adjacent bands,
the potential of adaptive guards is further increased and exploited with a
medium access control (MAC) layer scheduling technique. The proposed INI-based
scheduling algorithm decreases the need for guards by allocating the
numerologies to the available bands, considering their subcarrier spacing,
power level, and SIR requirements. Therefore, INI management is performed with
a cross-layer (PHY and MAC) approach in this study. The results show that the
precise design that accommodates such flexibility reduces the guards
significantly and improves the spectral efficiency of mixed numerology systems.

keeping the topology constant comfort these observations. The interpretation of
properties across structures is more challenging. An interesting point is that
smaller pores do not necessarily lead to larger confinement. In this work, the

criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual

is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing
platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a

domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is
often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects.
Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by
leveraging human computation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of
computational design with crowds with two illustrative examples: (1) estimating
the objective function (specifically, preference learning from crowds' pairwise
comparisons) to facilitate interactive design exploration by a designer and (2)
directly searching for the optimal parameter setting that maximizes the

during a total lunar eclipse which, if seen from the Moon, is like a transit of
the Earth in front of the Sun. We thus aim at transmission spectroscopy of an
Earth transit by tracing the solar spectrum during the total lunar eclipse of
January 21, 2019. Time series spectra of the Tycho crater were taken with the
Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large
Binocular Telescope (LBT) in its polarimetric mode in Stokes IQUV at a spectral
resolution of 130000 (0.06 \AA). In particular, the spectra cover the red parts
of the optical spectrum between 7419-9067 \AA . The spectrograph's exposure
meter was used to obtain a light curve of the lunar eclipse. The brightness of
the Moon dimmed by 10.75 mag during umbral eclipse. We found both branches of
the O$_2$ A-band almost completely saturated as well as a strong increase of
H$_2$O absorption during totality. The deep penumbral spectra show significant
excess absorption from the NaI 5890 \AA doublet, the CaII infrared triplet
around 8600 \AA, and the KI line at 7699 \AA in addition to several
hyper-fine-structure lines of MnI and even from BaII. The detections of the
latter two elements are likely due to an untypical solar center-to-limb effect
rather than Earth's atmosphere. The absorption in CaII and KI remained visible
throughout umbral eclipse. A small continuum polarization of the O$_2$ A-band
of 0.12\% during umbral eclipse was detected at 6.3$\sigma$. No line
polarization of the O$_2$ A-band, or any other spectral-line feature, is
detected outside nor inside eclipse. It places an upper limit of $\approx$0.2\%
on the degree of line polarization during transmission through Earth's
atmosphere and magnetosphere.

2002.08698v1,2020-02-20,2020-02-20,"Numerical simulation of the wave turbulence on the surface of a
  ferrofluid in a horizontal magnetic field","  The turbulence of capillary waves on the surface of a ferrofluid with a high
permeability in a horizontal magnetic field is considered in the framework of a
one-dimensional weakly nonlinear model. In the limit of a strong magnetic
field, the surface waves under study can propagate without distortions along or
against the direction of external field, i.e., similar to Alfv\'en waves in a
perfectly conducting fluid. The interaction of counter-propagating nonlinear
waves leads to the development of wave turbulence on the surface of the liquid.
The computational data show that the spectrum of turbulence is divided into two
parts: a low-frequency dispersionless region, where the magnetic forces
dominate and a high-frequency dispersive one, in which the influence of
capillary forces becomes significant. In the first region, the spectrum of the
surface elevation has the same exponent in $k$ and $\omega$ domains and its
value is close to $-3.5$, what is in a good agreement with the estimation
obtained from the dimensional analysis of the weak turbulence spectra. At the
high frequencies, the computed spatial spectrum of the surface waves is close
to $k^{-5/2}$ which corresponds to $\omega^{-5/3}$ in terms of the frequency.
This spectrum does not coincide with the Zakharov-Filonenko spectrum obtained
for pure capillary waves. A possible explanation of this fact is in the
influence of coherent structures (like shock waves) usually arising in media
with weak dispersion.

information transfer (WIT) and for challenging wireless power transfer (WPT),
which triggers the significant research interest in the topic of simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). By further exploiting the
advanced non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) technique, we are capable of
improving the spectrum efficiency of the resource-limited SWIPT system. In our
SWIPT system, a hybrid access point (H-AP) superimposes the modulated symbols
destined to multiple WIT users by exploiting the power-domain NOMA, while WPT
users are capable of harvesting the energy carried by the superposition
symbols. In order to maximise the amount of energy transferred to the WPT
users, we propose a joint design of the energy interleaver and the
constellation rotation based modulator in the symbol-block level by
constructively superimposing the symbols destined to the WIT users in the power
domain. Furthermore, a transmit power allocation scheme is proposed to
guarantee the symbol-error-ratio (SER) of all the WIT users. By considering the
sensitivity of practical energy harvesters, the simulation results demonstrate
that our scheme is capable of substantially increasing the WPT performance
without any remarkable degradation of the WIT performance.

different time pulses allows to discriminate whether different failure

  star-planet interaction","  Low frequency ($\nu\lesssim 150\,$MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to
originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the
stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal
structure, mass ejections, space-weather conditions around the planets (Schwenn
2006). Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have only detected
a single active flare-star (Lynch et al. 2017) that is not representative of
the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency
radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151--- a member of the most common
stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics
of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions (Zarka
1998) (e.g. Jupiter's decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure
dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show
that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of
mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to
main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio
emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151's slow rotation, but can originate in a
sub-Alfv\'{e}nic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period
exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations
(Zarka 2007; Lanza 2009; Saur et al. 2013; Turnpenney et al. 2018) for
interaction with an Earth-size planet in a $\sim 1-5$ day-long orbit.

analyzing and forecasting chaotic dynamical systems. We here analyze the
performance of one algorithm for the prediction of extreme events in the
two-dimensional H\'enon map at the classical parameters. The task is to
determine whether a trajectory will exceed a threshold after a set number of
time steps into the future. This task has a geometric interpretation within the
dynamics of the H\'enon map, which we use to gauge the performance of the
neural networks that are used in this work. We analyze the dependence of the
success rate of the ML models on the prediction time $T$ , the number of
training samples $N_T$ and the size of the network $N_p$. We observe that in
order to maintain a certain accuracy, $N_T \propto exp(2 h T)$ and $N_p \propto
exp(hT)$, where $h$ is the topological entropy. Similar relations between the
intrinsic chaotic properties of the dynamics and ML parameters might be
observable in other systems as well.

  coupling induced electronic crossover in the YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ superconductor","  Here, by conducting a systematic $^{89}$Y NMR study, we explore the nature of
the magnetic ground state in a newly discovered iron-based superconductor
YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. An incoherent-to-coherent crossover due to the Hund's coupling
induced electronic correlation is revealed below the crossover temperature
$T^*\sim 75\pm15\,\mathrm{K}$. During the electronic crossover, both the Knight
shift ($K$) and the bulk magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) exhibit a similar
nonmonotonic temperature dependence, and a so-called Knight shift anomaly is
also revealed by a careful $K$-$\chi$ analysis. Such an electronic crossover
has been also observed in heavily hole-doped pnictide superconductors
\emph{A}Fe$_2$As$_2$ (\emph{A} = K, Rb, and Cs), which is ascribed to the
Hund's coupling induced electronic correlation. Below $T^*$, the spin-lattice
relaxation rate divided by temperature $(1/T_1T)$ shows a similar suppression
as the Knight shift, suggesting the absence of critical spin fluctuations. This
seems to be in conflict with a predicted magnetic quantum critical point (QCP)
near this system. However, considering a $\mathbf{q}$-dependent ""filter"" effect
on the transferred hyperfine field, a predominant spin fluctuation with A-type
correlation would be perfectly filtered out at $^{89}$Y sites, which is
consistent with the recent inelastic neutron scattering results. Therefore, our
results confirm that, through a Hund's coupling induced electronic crossover,
the magnetic ground state of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ becomes close to an itinerant
magnetic QCP with A-type spin fluctuations. In addition, the possible
superconducting pairing due to spin fluctuations is also discussed.

large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, i.e., Minkowski functionals (MFs).
The morphology of LSS can be fully described by four MFs. This tool, with
strong statistical power, is robust to various systematics and can
comprehensively probe all orders of N-point statistics. By using a pair of
high-resolution N-body simulations, for the first time, we comprehensively
studied the subtle neutrino effects on the morphology of LSS. For an ideal LSS
survey of volume $\sim1.73$ Gpc$^3$/$h^3$, neutrino signals are mainly detected
from void regions with a significant level up to $\thicksim 10\sigma$ and
$\thicksim 300\sigma$ for CDM and total matter density fields, respectively.
This demonstrates its enormous potential for much improving the neutrino mass
constraint in the data analysis of up-coming ambitious LSS surveys.

neutron and quark stars is not determined despite there are several
sophisticated models to describe it. From the electromagnetic observations,
summarized in \cite{Lattimer01}, and the recent observation of gravitational
waves from binary neutron star inspiral GW170817 \cite{Abbott2017_etal} and

of masses and so constraint the mass of the neutron and quark stars,
determining not only the best approximation for the EoS, but which kind of
stars we would be observing. In this paper we explore several configurations of
neutron stars assuming a simple polytropic equation of state, using a single
layer model without crust. In particular, when the EoS depends on the mass rest
density, $p=K \rho_{0}^{\Gamma}$, and when it depends on the energy density
$p=K \rho^{\Gamma}$, considerable differences in the mass-radius relationships
are found. On the other hand, we also explore quark stars models using the MIT
bag EoS for different values of the vacuum energy density $B$.

is between $\sim$ 27 and 42% depending on the method used to define the HII
region boundaries. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the DIG
exhibits enhanced [SII]/H$\alpha$ and [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios and a median
temperature that is $\sim$ 3000 K higher than in HII regions. We also observe
an apparent inverse correlation between temperature and H$\alpha$ surface
brightness. Overall, the observed [SII]6716/6731 ratio is consistent within
1$\sigma$ with $n_e$ < 30 cm$^{-3}$, with an almost identical distribution for
the DIG and HII regions. The velocity dispersion of the ionised gas indicates
that the DIG has a higher degree of turbulence than the HII regions. Comparison
with photoionisation and shock models reveals that the diffuse component can
only partially be explained via shocks and that it is most likely consistent
with photons leaking from density bounded HII regions or with radiation from
evolved field stars. [abridged]

(about 20 ks) compared to the second and third (about 13 ks). This pattern is
consistent with the alternating long-short recurrence times of the GSN 069
QPEs, although the difference between the consecutive recurrence times is
significantly smaller in GSN 069. Longer X-ray observations will better clarify
the temporal pattern of the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 and will allow a detailed
comparison with GSN 069 to be performed. The X-ray spectral properties of QPEs
in the two sources are remarkably similar, with QPEs representing fast
transitions from a relatively cold and likely disk-dominated state to a state
that is characterized by a warmer emission similar to the so-called soft X-ray
excess, a component that is almost ubiquitously seen in the X-ray spectra of
unobscured, radiatively efficient active galaxies. Previous X-ray observations
of RX J1301.9+2747 in 2000 and 2009 strongly suggest that QPEs have been
present for at least the past 18.5 years. The detection of QPEs from a second
galactic nucleus after GSN 069 rules out contamination by a Galactic source in
both cases, such that QPEs ought to be considered a novel extragalactic
phenomenon associated with accreting supermassive black holes.

emitters at a mean redshift z=0.83. The minimum detectable line flux and
equivalent width (EW) in this ELS sample are $\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{-19}$ erg

faint-end slope ($\alpha = -1.03\pm0.08$) of the observed LF([O III]) at

behavior of cuboctahedron (cub) and icosahedron (ico) nanoparticles with 2-20
number of full shells. The original embedded atom method (EAM) was compared to
the more recent highly optimized version as inter-atomic potential. The thermal
stability of clusters were probed using potential energy and specific heat
capacity as well as structure analysis by radial distribution function, G(r),
and common neighbor analysis (CNA), simultaneously, to make a comprehensive
picture of the solid state and melting transitions. The result shows ico is the
only stable shape of small clusters (Pd55-Pd309 using original EAM and Pd55
using optimized version) those are melting uniformly due to their small
diameter. An exception is cub Pd309 modeled via optimized EAM that transforms
to ico at elevated temperatures. A similar cub to ico transition was predicted
by original EAM for Pd923-Pd2075 clusters while for the larger clusters both
cub and ico are stable up to the melting point. As detected by G(r) and CNA,
moderate and large cub clusters were showing surface melting by nucleation of
the liquid phase at (100) planes and growth of liquid phase at the surface
before inward growth. While diagonal (one corner to another) melting was
dominating over ico clusters owing to their partitioned structure which
retarded the growth of the liquid phase. The large ico cluster, using optimized
EAM, presented a combination of surface and diagonal melting due to the
simultaneous diagonal melting started from different corners. Finally, the
melting temperature as well as latent heat of fusion were calculated and
compared with available models and previous studies which showed, unlike the
present result, the models failed to predict size-dependent motif crossover.

total energy as a function of the magnetization, we show that a Stoner-type
model describing the electronic instability of the narrow impurity band
accounts for the origin of $sp$-magnetism in P-graphene and N-silicene. Under
biaxial strain the impurity band dispersion increases and the magnetic moment
gradually decreases, with the consequent collapse of the magnetization at
moderate strain values. Thus, we found that biaxial strain induces a magnetic
quantum phase transition in P-graphene and N-silicene.

addition to classical representations using matrices or lists, some compressed
data structures have recently been proposed to represent binary relations in
compact space, such as the $k^2$-tree and the Binary Relation Wavelet Tree
(BRWT). Knowing their storage needs, supported operations and time performance
is key for enabling an appropriate choice of data representation given a domain
or application, its data distribution and typical operations that are computed
over the data.
  In this work, we present an empirical comparison among several compressed
representations for binary relations. We analyze their space usage and the
speed of their operations using different (synthetic and real) data
distributions. We include both neighborhood and set operations, also proposing
algorithms for set operations for the BRWT, which were not presented before in
the literature. We conclude that there is not a clear choice that outperforms
the rest, but we give some recommendations of usage of each compact
representation depending on the data distribution and types of operations
performed over the data. We also include a scalability study of the data
representations.

can be simplified by incorporating the transient potential. Then the dynamic
equation for the mesoscopic degrees of freedom can be simply described by the
Langevin equation with the transient potential (LETP). As a simple and
analytically tractable approximation, we introduce additional degrees of
freedom which express the state of the transient potential. Then we
approximately express the dynamics of the system as the the combination of the
LETP and the dynamics model for the transient potential. The resulting dynamics
model has the same dynamical structure as the responsive particle dynamics

handling of interactions between conversation and recommendation. We argue that
three fundamental problems need to be solved: 1) what questions to ask
regarding item attributes, 2) when to recommend items, and 3) how to adapt to
the users' online feedback. To the best of our knowledge, there lacks a unified
framework that addresses these problems.
  In this work, we fill this missing interaction framework gap by proposing a
new CRS framework named Estimation-Action-Reflection, or EAR, which consists of
three stages to better converse with users. (1) Estimation, which builds
predictive models to estimate user preference on both items and item
attributes; (2) Action, which learns a dialogue policy to determine whether to
ask attributes or recommend items, based on Estimation stage and conversation
history; and (3) Reflection, which updates the recommender model when a user
rejects the recommendations made by the Action stage. We present two
conversation scenarios on binary and enumerated questions, and conduct
extensive experiments on two datasets from Yelp and LastFM, for each scenario,
respectively. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over the

network that has a critical point with power-law avalanches and synaptic
balance. When short term depression in inhibitory synapses and firing threshold
adaptation are added, the system hovers around the critical point. This
homeostatically self-organized quasi-critical (SOqC) dynamics generates E/I
synaptic current cancellation in fast time scales, causing fluctuation-driven
asynchronous-irregular (AI) firing. We present the full phase diagram of the
model without adaptation varying external input versus synaptic coupling. This
system has a rich dynamical repertoire of spiking patterns: synchronous regular
(SR), asynchronous regular (AR), synchronous irregular (SI), slow oscillations

inhibitory currents try and compensate excitatory currents over time, resulting
in both of them scaling linearly with external input. Our model thus unifies
two different perspectives on cortical spontaneous activity: both critical

2002.09171v1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,"Computing 3D chromatin configurations from contact probability maps by
  Inverse Brownian Dynamics","  The three-dimensional organization of chromatin, on the length scale of a few
genes, is crucial in determining the functional state - accessibility and the
amount of gene expression - of the chromatin. Recent advances in chromosome
conformation capture experiments provide partial information on the chromatin
organization in a cell population, namely the contact count between any segment
pairs, but not on the interaction strength that leads to these contact counts.
However, given the contact matrix, determining the complete 3D organization of
the whole chromatin polymer is an inverse problem. In the present work, a novel
Inverse Brownian Dynamics (IBD) method based on a coarse grained bead-spring
chain model has been proposed to compute the optimal interaction strengths
between different segments of chromatin such that the experimentally measured
contact count probability constraints are satisfied. Applying this method to
the {\alpha}-globin gene locus in two different cell types, we predict the 3D
organizations corresponding to active and repressed states of chromatin at the
locus. We show that the average distance between any two segments of the region
has a broad distribution and cannot be computed as a simple inverse relation
based on the contact probability alone. The results presented for multiple
normalization methods suggest that all measurable quantities may crucially
depend on the nature of normalization. We argue that by experimentally
measuring predicted quantities, one may infer the appropriate form of
normalization.

cyberattacks. Multiple vendors provide security solutions developed using
heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. Hence, it is a challenging rather
impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion.
Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools
that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of
a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of
security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on
different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been
no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We
report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and
reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on
different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until
July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of
security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security
orchestration into three main areas: unification, orchestration, and
automation. We have also identified the core components of a security
orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration
based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of
security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy,
deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us to
reveal several areas of further research and development in security
orchestration.

small-sized, easy to interpret. Traditionally, a greedy approach has been used
to build the trees, yielding a very fast training process; however, controlling
sparsity (a proxy for interpretability) is challenging. In recent studies,
optimal decision trees, where all decisions are optimized simultaneously, have
shown a better learning performance, especially when oblique cuts are
implemented. In this paper, we propose a continuous optimization approach to
build sparse optimal classification trees, based on oblique cuts, with the aim
of using fewer predictor variables in the cuts as well as along the whole tree.
Both types of sparsity, namely local and global, are modeled by means of
regularizations with polyhedral norms. The computational experience reported
supports the usefulness of our methodology. In all our data sets, local and
global sparsity can be improved without harming classification accuracy. Unlike
greedy approaches, our ability to easily trade in some of our classification
accuracy for a gain in global sparsity is shown.

and neutron detectors to tag the scattered neutrons; in particular, the
quenching factor values for nuclear recoils along different crystallographic
axes have been determined for three different neutron scattering angles (i.e.
nuclear recoils energies). From these measurements, the anisotropy of the light
response for nuclear recoils in the ZnWO$_4$ crystal scintillator has been
determined at 5.4 standard deviations.

  absorption in HII regions","  The observed interaction product of Cosmic Rays (CRs) and Galactic magnetic
fields (GMF) is the Galactic synchrotron emission integrated over the
line-of-sight (LOS). The GMF strength and morphology and the CR density can be
probed by comparing this tracer to simulations using existing GMF models and CR
density models. Our aim is to provide insight into these parameters by
exploring and explaining the differences between simulations and observations
of synchrotron intensity. At low radio frequencies HII regions become opaque
due to free-free absorption. Using these HII regions we can measure the
synchrotron intensity over a part of the LOS through the Galaxy. The measured
intensity per unit path length, i.e. the emissitivity, for HII regions at
different distances, will allow probing variation in synchrotron emission in
the third dimension of distance. Using a number of existing GMF models in
conjunction with the Galactic CR modeling code GALPROP we can simulate these
synchrotron emissivities. We present an updated catalog of low-frequency
absorption measurements of HII regions compiled from the literature. We report
a simulated emissivity that shows a compatible trend for HII regions that are
near to the observer. And we observe a systematically increasing synchrotron
emissivity for HII regions that are far from the observer, which is not
compatible with simulated values. Current GMF and CR density models cannot
explain low-frequency absorption measurements. One possibility is that
distances to all HII regions at the kinematic 'far' distance are wrong, though
this is unlikely as it ignores all evidence in the literature. However, a
detection bias due to the nature of this tracer requires us to keep in mind
that certain sources may be missed in an observation. The other possibilities
are an enhanced emissivity in the outer Galaxy or a diminished emissivity in
the inner Galaxy.

external environment, where the time evolution is driven by the continuous
limit of certain $2$-local random unitary circuits. We study both cases where
the unitaries are chosen with and without a conserved $U(1)$ charge and focus
on two aspects of the dynamics. First, we study analytically and numerically
the growth of the entanglement entropy of the system, showing that two
different time scales appear: one is intrinsic to the internal dynamics (the
scrambling time), while the other depends on the system-environment coupling.
In the presence of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, we show that the entanglement
follows a Page-like behavior in time: it begins to decrease in the middle stage
of the ""evaporation"", and decreases monotonically afterwards. Second, we study
the time needed to retrieve information initially injected in the system from
measurements on the environment qudits. Based on explicit numerical
computations, we characterize such time both when the retriever has control
over the initial configuration or not, showing that different scales appear in
the two cases.

Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) PIONIER instrument (1.53-1.78
$\mathrm{\mu}$m) between May and July 2016, and April and July 2019 with
different telescope configurations. We compared the image reconstructions with
81 temporal snapshots of 3D radiative-hydrodynamics (RHD) CO$^5$BOLD
simulations in terms of contrast and morphology, using the Structural
Similarity Index. Results. The interferometric data are compatible with an
overall spherical disk of angular diameter 4.4$\pm$0.2 mas, and an extended
molecular layer. In 2016, the reconstructed image reveals a bright arc-like
feature toward the northern rim of the photospheric surface. In 2019, an
arc-like feature is seen at a different orientation and a new peak of emission
is detected on the opposite side. The contrasts of the reconstructed surface
images are 11%$\pm$2% and 9%$\pm$2% for 2016 and 2019, respectively. The
morphology and contrast of the two images are consistent with 3D RHD
simulations, within our achieved spatial resolution and dynamic range. The
extended molecular layer contributes 10--13% of the total flux with an angular
diameter of 6--8 mas. It is present but not clearly visible in the
reconstructed images because it is close to the limits of the achieved dynamic
range. The presence of the molecular layer is not reproduced by the 3D RHD
simulations. Conclusions...

($M_{\ast}$), and SF rates from $IRAS$ far-infrared fluxes - and calculate
depletion times and gas fractions. We traced the central stellar mass
concentration from the inner slope of the stellar component of the rotation
curves. Starbursts are defined as galaxies with a factor $>4$ enhanced SF rate
relative to a control sample of non-interacting galaxies which are $\pm 0.2$
dex in stellar mass and $\pm 1$ in $T$-type. Starbursts are mainly early-type
($T\lesssim 5$), massive spiral galaxies ($M_{\ast}\gtrsim 10^{10}M_{\odot}$)
that are not necessarily interacting. For a given stellar mass bin, starbursts
are characterised by lower gas depletion times, similar gas fractions, and
larger central stellar mass concentrations than non-starburst galaxies. The
global distributions of gas fraction and gas depletion time are not
statistically different for interacting and non-interacting galaxies. However,
in the case of currently merging galaxies, the median gas depletion time is a
factor of $0.4 \pm 0.2$ that of control sample galaxies, and their SF rates are
a factor of $1.9 \pm 0.5$ enhanced, even though the median gas fraction is
similar. Starbursts present long-lasting SF in the circumnuclear regions that
causes an enhancement of the central stellar density at $z\approx0$ in both

timescales, yet similar gas fractions as normal main-sequence galaxies. Galaxy
mergers cause a moderate enhancement of the SF efficiency (Abridged).

prediction of the transition of the axisymmetric flow to fully

numerical simulations rely on an improved one-sided model of evaporation by
including heat and mass transfer through the gas phase via the heat transfer
Biot number and the evaporative Biot number. We present the axisymmetric flow

numbers, and more importantly elucidate the twofold role of the latent heat of
evaporation in the stability; evaporation not only destabilizes the flow but
also stabilizes it, depending upon the place where the evaporation-induced
thermal gradients come into play. We also show that buoyancy in the liquid
layer has a stabilizing effect, though its effect is insignificant. At high
Marangoni numbers, the numerical simulations revealed smaller-scale thermal
patterns formed on the surface of a thinner evaporating layer, in qualitative
agreement with experimental observations. The present work helps to gain a

2002.09397v2,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,"Relaxation and vibrational properties in metal alloys and other
  disordered systems","  The relaxation dynamics and the vibrational spectra of amorphous solids, such
as metal alloys, have been intensely investigated as well separated topics in
the past. The aim of this review is to summarize recent results in both these
areas in an attempt to establish, or unveil, deeper connections between the two
phenomena of relaxation and vibration. Theoretical progress in the area of slow
relaxation dynamics of liquid and glassy systems and in the area of vibrational
spectra of glasses and liquids is reviewed. After laying down a generic
modelling framework to connect vibration and relaxation, the physics of metal
alloys is considered where the emergence of power-law exponents has been
identified both in the vibrational density of states (VDOS) as well as in
density correlations. Also, theoretical frameworks which connect the VDOS to
the relaxation behaviour and mechanical viscoelastic response in metallic
glasses are reviewed. The same generic interpretative framework is then applied
to the case of molecular glass formers where the emergence of
stretched-exponential relaxation in dielectric relaxation can be put in
quantitative relation with the VDOS by means of memory-function approaches.
Further connections between relaxation and vibration are provided by the study
of phonon linewidths in liquids and glasses, where a natural starting point is
given by hydrodynamic theories. Finally, an agenda of outstanding issues
including the appearance of compressed exponential relaxation in the
intermediate scattering function of experimental and simulated systems (metal
alloys, colloidal gels, jammed packings) is presented in light of available (or
yet to be developed) mathematical models, and compared to non-exponential
behaviour measured with macroscopic means such as mechanical
spectroscopy/rheology.

  operators on the lattice in the auxiliary field approach","  Nonlocal quark bilinear operators connected by link paths are used for
studying parton distribution functions (PDFs) and transverse momentum-dependent
PDFs of hadrons using lattice QCD. The nonlocality makes it difficult to
understand the renormalization and improvement of these operators using
standard methods. In previous work, we showed that by introducing an auxiliary
field on the lattice, one can understand an on-axis Wilson-line operator as the
product of two local operators in an extended theory. In this paper, we provide
details about the calculation in perturbation theory of the factor for
conversion from our lattice-suitable renormalization scheme to the MS-bar
scheme. Extending our work, we study Symanzik improvement of the extended
theory to understand the pattern of discretization effects linear in the
lattice spacing, $a$, which are present even if the lattice fermion action
exactly preserves chiral symmetry. This provides a prospect for an eventual
$O(a)$ improvement of lattice calculations of PDFs. We also generalize our
approach to apply to Wilson lines along lattice diagonals and to
piecewise-straight link paths.

team, we initiated a search for other massive clusters of galaxies missing from
the standard X-ray catalogs. We began by identifying 25 cluster candidates not
included in the Meta-Catalog of X-ray Clusters of galaxies cluster compilation
through cross-identification of the central galaxies of optically identified
clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey GMBCG catalog with bright X-ray
sources in the ROSAT Bright Source Catalog. Those candidates were mostly
unidentified or previously classified as X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN).
We analyzed brief Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of 14 of these X-ray
sources and found that eight are X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies, only one
showing evidence for a central X-ray point source. The remaining six candidates
turned out to be point-source dominated, with faint detections or upper limits
on any extended emission. We were not able to rule out the presence of extended
X-ray emission from any of the point sources. The levels of extended emission
around the six point sources are consistent with expectations based on optical
richness, but could also be contaminated by scattered X-ray light from the
central point source or extended nonthermal emission from possible radio lobes.
We characterize the extended components of each of the well-detected cluster
sources, finding that six of the eight X-ray clusters are consistent with being
compact cool-core clusters. One of the newly identified low-luminosity X-ray
clusters may have had an X-ray-luminous AGN 20 yr prior to the recent Chandra
observations, based on the 4{\sigma} difference between its Chandra and ROSAT
fluxes.

2002.09439v1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,Tearing and related field distortions in deep-depletion CCDs,"  Tearing patterns affecting flat field frames in CCDs are a visually striking
obstacle to performing Pixel Response Non-Uniformity corrections. These
patterns can be explained by lateral field distortions, caused by the
non-uniform distribution of holes in the channel stops between sensor columns.
Over the course of LSST camera development, a number of practical fixes have
been suggested to get rid of tearing. But applying these fixes to our
16-channel Teledyne-e2v sensors leaves at best a distortion pattern at the
vertical edges of every segment. Our working hypothesis is that the origin of
the tearing is the parallel clocking itself, which moves the holes that are
present in the channel stops regions. The efficiency of these transfers depends
strongly on the details of the clocking operations, resulting in the observed
variety of distortion patterns. Removal of most of the distortion patterns can
therefore be achieved by executing a purge operation, which flattens back the
hole distribution in the channel stops, immediately before acquiring a frame. A
more effective solution is to switch all clocking operations to use a bipolar
voltage set.

abundance enhancement of rare elements like 3He or ultra-heavy nuclei, have
been a puzzle for more than 50 years. One reason for the current lack of
understanding of 3He-rich SEPs is the difficulty resolving the source regions
of these commonly occurring events. Since their discovery, there has been
strong evidence that 3He-rich SEP production is associated with flares on the
Sun. Anomalous abundances of 3He-rich SEPs have been attributed to a unique
acceleration mechanism that must routinely operate at flare sites. Flares
associated with 3He-rich SEPs have been often observed in jet-like forms
indicating an acceleration in magnetic reconnection involving field lines open
to interplanetary space. Owing to a fleet of spacecraft around the Sun,
providing a greatly improved resolution of solar imaging observations, 3He-rich
SEP sources are now explored in unprecedented detail. This paper outlines the
current understanding of 3He-rich SEPs, mainly focusing on their solar sources.

2003.00880v1,2020-02-21,2020-02-21,Introducing Fuzzy Layers for Deep Learning,"  Many state-of-the-art technologies developed in recent years have been
influenced by machine learning to some extent. Most popular at the time of this
writing are artificial intelligence methodologies that fall under the umbrella
of deep learning. Deep learning has been shown across many applications to be
extremely powerful and capable of handling problems that possess great
complexity and difficulty. In this work, we introduce a new layer to deep
learning: the fuzzy layer. Traditionally, the network architecture of neural
networks is composed of an input layer, some combination of hidden layers, and
an output layer. We propose the introduction of fuzzy layers into the deep
learning architecture to exploit the powerful aggregation properties expressed
through fuzzy methodologies, such as the Choquet and Sugueno fuzzy integrals.
To date, fuzzy approaches taken to deep learning have been through the
application of various fusion strategies at the decision level to aggregate
outputs from state-of-the-art pre-trained models, e.g., AlexNet, VGG16,
GoogLeNet, Inception-v3, ResNet-18, etc. While these strategies have been shown
to improve accuracy performance for image classification tasks, none have
explored the use of fuzzified intermediate, or hidden, layers. Herein, we
present a new deep learning strategy that incorporates fuzzy strategies into
the deep learning architecture focused on the application of semantic
segmentation using per-pixel classification. Experiments are conducted on a
benchmark data set as well as a data set collected via an unmanned aerial
system at a U.S. Army test site for the task of automatic road segmentation,
and preliminary results are promising.

information technology. Quantum-mechanical sources of randomness are attractive
because of the indeterminism of individual quantum processes. Here we consider
the production of random bits from polarization measurements on photons. We
first present a pedagogical discussion of how the quantum randomness inherent
in such measurements is connected to quantum coherence, and how it can be
quantified in terms of the quantum state and an associated entropy value known
as min-entropy. We then explore these concepts by performing a series of
single-photon experiments that are suitable for the undergraduate laboratory.
We prepare photons in different nonentangled and entangled states, and measure
these states tomographically. We use the information about the quantum state to
determine, in terms of the min-entropy, the minimum amount of randomness
produced from a given photon state by different bit-generating measurements.
This is helpful in assessing the presence of quantum randomness and in ensuring
the quality and security of the random-bit source.

masses. We distinguish the contributions from QCD and QED in the baryon mass
splittings. We find that the mixing angle between $\Sigma^0$ and $\Lambda^0$ is
$(2.07\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2} $, which leads to the decay branching fraction

Particularly, we design a shallow-to-deep architecture on the basis of

involves multi-level convolutional networks to parse indoor semantics/geometry
into non-relational and relational knowledge. Non-relational knowledge
extracted from shallow-end networks (e.g. room layout, object geometry) is fed
forward into deeper levels to parse relational semantics (e.g. support
relationship). A Relation Network is proposed to infer the support relationship
between objects. All the structured semantics and geometry above are assembled
to guide a global optimization for 3D scene modeling. Qualitative and
quantitative analysis demonstrates the feasibility of our method in
understanding and modeling semantics-enriched indoor scenes by evaluating the
performance of reconstruction accuracy, computation performance and scene

samples have been widely used to estimate red noise in solar period-periodic
signals. To MCMC, proper priors and sufficient iterations are prerequisites
ensuring the accuracy of red noise estimation. We used MCMC-based Bayesian
inferences to estimate 100 groups of red noise synthesized randomly for
evaluating its accuracy. At the same time, the Brooks-Gelman algorithm was
employed to precisely diagnose the convergence of the Markov chains generated
by MCMC. The root-mean-square error of parameter inferences to the synthetic
data is only 1.14. Furthermore, we applied the algorithm to analyze the
oscillation modes in a sunspot and a flare. A 70 s period is detected in the
sunspot umbra in addition to 3- and 5-minute periods, and a 40 s period is
detected in the flare. The results prove that estimating red noise with
MCMC-based Bayesian has more high accuracy in the case of proper priors and
convergence. We also find that the number of iterations increases dramatically
to achieve convergence as the number of parameters grows. Therefore, we
strongly recommend that when estimating red noise with MCMC-based Bayesian,
different initial values must be selected to ensure that the entire posterior
distribution is covered.

the extrinsic contribution, i.e., the skew scattering and side jump, turned out
to be small. In addition to the large AHE, it was found the types of majority
carriers changed at approximately 275 and 30 K, consistent with the critical
temperatures of the spin reorientation. These findings suggest that the
hexagonal ferromagnetic Fe5Sn3 single crystal is an excellent candidate to use
for the study of the topological features in ferromagnets.

in a bipartite graph (bigraph). A quasi-biclique in the bigraph is its ""almost""
complete subgraph. The relaxation of completeness can be understood variously;
here, we assume that the subgraph is a $\gamma$-quasi-biclique if it lacks a
certain number of edges to form a biclique such that its density is at least
$\gamma \in (0,1]$. For a bigraph and fixed $\gamma$, the problem of searching
for the maximal quasi-biclique consists of finding a subset of vertices of the
bigraph such that the induced subgraph is a quasi-biclique and its size is
maximal for a given graph. Several models based on Mixed Integer Programming
(MIP) to search for a quasi-biclique are proposed and tested for working
efficiency. An alternative model inspired by biclustering is formulated and
tested; this model simultaneously maximizes both the size of the quasi-biclique
and its density, using the least-square criterion similar to the one exploited
by triclustering \textsc{TriBox}.

when a strong driving field is used to render an otherwise opaque material
transparent. The effect is known as electromagnetically induced transparency in
atomic media and optomechanically induced transparency in systems that consist
of coupled optical and mechanical resonators. In this work, we introduce the
concept of photothermally induced transparency (PTIT). It happens when an
optical resonator exhibits non-linear behavior due to optical heating of the
resonator or its mirrors. Similar to the established mechanisms for induced
transparency, PTIT can suppress the coupling between an optical resonator and a
traveling optical field. We further show that the dispersion of the resonator
can be modified to exhibit slow or fast light. Because of the relatively slow
thermal response, we observe the bandwidth of the PTIT to be $2\pi\times15.9$
Hz which theoretically suggests a group velocity of as low as $5$ m/s.

addition, our findings show that one can draw on the optomechanical interaction
to revive the CEP-dependent effects on optical pulses with an arbitrary number
of cycles and without specific intensity requirements. The effects of CEP,
broadly extended to encompass few- and multi-cycle optical and mechanical

in astrophysics or in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. For
mixtures containing species with large differences in atomic number Z, the
modeling needs to consider at the same time the kinetic theory for low-Z
elements combined with the theory of strongly coupled plasma for high-Z
elements, as well as all the intermediate situations that can appear in
multi-component systems. For such cases, we study the pair distribution
functions, self-diffusions, mutual diffusion and viscosity for ternary mixtures
at extreme conditions. These quantities can be produced from first principles
using orbital free molecular dynamics at the computational expense of very
intensive simulations to reach good statistics. Utilizing the first-principles
results as reference data, we assess the merit of a global analytic model for
transport coefficients, Pseudo-Ions in Jellium (PIJ), based on an
iso-electronic assumption ( iso-n e ). With a multi-component hypernetted-chain
integral equation, we verify the quality of the iso-n e prescription for
describing the static structure of the mixtures. This semi-analytical modeling
compares well with the simulation results and allows one to consider plasma
mixtures not accessible to simulations. Applications are given for the mix of
materials in ICF experiments. A reduction of a multicomponent mixture to an
effective binary mixture is also established in the hydrodynamic limit and
compared with PIJ estimations for ICF relevant mixtures.

that this surprising noncollinear magnetic structure is due to a competition
between the single-ion anisotropy trying to keep moments, similar to the ground

forcing them to be perpendicular to each other and application of the external

  and vibrational properties of few layer black phosphorus","  The encapsulation of two-dimensional layered materials such as black
phosphorus is of paramount importance for their stability in air. However, the
encapsulation poses several questions, namely, how it affects, via the weak van
der Waals forces, the properties of the black phosphorus and whether these
properties can be tuned on demand. Prompted by these questions, we have
investigated the impact of hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation on the
structural and vibrational properties of few layer black phosphorus, using a
first-principles method in the framework of density functional theory. We
demonstrate that the encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride imposes biaxial
strain on the black phosphorus material, flattening its puckered structure, by
decreasing the thickness of the layers via the increase of the puckered angle
and the intra-layer P-P bonds. This work exemplifies the evolution of
structural parameters in layered materials after the encapsulation process. We
find that after encapsulation, phosphorene (single layer black phosphorous)
contracts by 1.1% in the armchair direction and stretches by 1.3% in the zigzag
direction, whereas few layer black phosphorus mainly expands by up to 3% in the
armchair direction. However, these relatively small strains induced by the
hexagonal BN, lead to significant changes in the vibrational properties of
black phosphorus, with the redshifts of up to 10 cm$^{-1}$ of the high
frequency optical mode $A_g^1$. In general, structural changes induced by the
encapsulation process open the door to substrate controlled strain engineering
in two-dimensional crystals.

$\rm DM_{IGM}$, the contribution from IGM to the observed dispersion measure

history. We can thus study the evolution of the universe by using FRBs with

baryon mass in the IGM, $f_{\rm IGM}$, which is useful to study the cosmic
expansion and the problem of the ""missing baryons"". We propose to reconstruct
the evolution of $f_{\rm IGM}$ as a function of redshift $z$ with FRBs via a
completely model-independent method, namely Gaussian processes. Since there is
not a large sample of FRBs with identified redshifts, we use simulated FRBs

  CO, CS, CN, and H2CO around DG Tau B","  The chemical composition of planets is inherited by the distribution of the
various molecular species in the protoplanetary disk at thetime of their
formation. As of today, only a handful of disks has been imaged in multiple
spectral lines with high spatial resolution. As part of a small campaign
devoted to the chemical characterization of disk-outflow sources in Taurus, we
report on new ALMA Band 6 observations with 20 au resolution toward the
embedded young star DG Tau B. Images of the continuum emission reveals a dust
disk with rings and, putatively, a leading spiral arm. The disk, as well as the
prominent outflow cavities, are detected in CO, H2CO, CS, and CN while they
remain undetected in SO2, HDO, and CH3OH. From the absorption of the back-side
outflow, we inferred that the disk emission is optically thick in the inner 50
au. This morphology explains why no line emission is detected from this inner
region and poses some limitations toward the calculation of the dust mass and
the characterization of the inner gaseous disk. The H2CO and CS emission from
the inner 200 au is mostly from the disk and their morphology is very similar.
The CN emission significantly differs from the other two molecules as it is
observed only beyond 150 au. This ring-like morphology is consistent with
previous observations and the predictions of thermochemical disk models.
Finally, we constrained the disk-integrated column density of all molecules. In
particular, we found that the CH3OH/H2CO ratio must be smaller than 2, making
the methanol non-detection still consistent with the only such a ratio
available from the literature (1.27 in TW Hya).

two-body system composed of a point particle orbiting a fixed central mass have
been analytically computed so far with a variety of approaches. We offer our
contribution by analytically computing $\dot\omega^\mathrm{2PN}$ in a
perturbative way with the method of variation of elliptical elements by
explicitly calculating both the direct contribution due to the 2PN acceleration
${\boldsymbol A}^\mathrm{2PN}$, and also an indirect part arising from the
self-interaction of the 1PN acceleration ${\boldsymbol A}^\mathrm{1PN}$ in the
orbital average accounting for the instantaneous shifts induced by

obtained for both the point particle and full two-body cases without recurring

2002.10377v1,2020-02-24,2020-02-24,Crumples as a generic stress-focusing instability in confined sheets,"  Thin elastic solids are easily deformed into a myriad of three-dimensional
shapes, which may contain sharp localized structures as in a crumpled candy
wrapper, or have smooth and diffuse features like the undulating edge of a
flower. Anticipating and controlling these morphologies is crucial to a variety
of applications involving textiles, synthetic skins, and inflatable structures.
Here we show that a ""wrinkle-to-crumple"" transition, previously observed in
specific settings, is a ubiquitous response for confined sheets. This unified
picture is borne out of a suite of model experiments on polymer films confined
to liquid interfaces with spherical, hyperbolic, and cylindrical geometries,
which are complemented by experiments on macroscopic membranes inflated with
gas. We use measurements across this wide range of geometries, boundary
conditions, and lengthscales to quantify several robust morphological features
of the crumpled phase, and we build an empirical phase diagram for crumple
formation that disentangles the competing effects of curvature and compression.
Our results suggest that crumples are a generic microstructure that emerge at
large curvatures due to a competition of elastic and substrate energies.

2002.10379v2,2020-02-24,2020-02-24,"The effect of internal gravity waves on cloud evolution in sub-stellar
  atmospheres","  Sub-stellar objects exhibit photometric variability, which is believed to be
caused by a number of processes, such as magnetically-driven spots or
inhomogeneous cloud coverage. Recent models have shown that turbulent flows and
waves, including internal gravity waves, may play an important role in cloud
evolution.
  The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of IGW on dust nucleation
and dust growth, and whether observations of the resulting cloud structures
could be used to recover atmospheric density information.
  For a simplified atmosphere in two dimensions, we numerically solved the
governing fluid equations to simulate the effect on dust nucleation and mantle
growth as a result of the passage of an IGW. Furthermore, we derived an
expression that relates the properties of the wave-induced cloud structures to
observable parameters in order to deduce the atmospheric density.
  Numerical simulations show that the $\rho, p, T$ variations caused by gravity
waves lead to an increase of the nucleation rate by up to a factor 20, and an
increase of the mantle growth rate by up to a factor 1.6, compared to their
equilibrium values. An exploration of the wider parameter space shows that in
absolute terms, the increase in nucleation due to IGW is stronger in cooler (T
dwarfs) and TiO2-rich sub-stellar atmospheres. The relative increase, however,
is greater in warmer (L dwarf) and TiO2-poor atmospheres due to conditions less
suited for efficient nucleation at equilibrium. These variations lead to banded
areas in which dust formation is much more pronounced, similar to the cloud
structures observed on Earth.
  We show that IGW in the atmosphere of sub-stellar objects can produce banded
clouds structures similar to that observed on Earth. We propose a method with
which potential observations of banded clouds could be used to estimate the
atmospheric density of sub-stellar objects.

sufficient lateral separation between droplets of identical surface tension, a

differences between the coalescing droplets, the surface jet can be either
enhanced or suppressed via a Marangoni flow. The influence of the initial

2002.10469v1,2020-02-24,2020-02-24,Hidden magnetic fields of young suns,"  Global magnetic fields of active solar-like stars are nowadays routinely
detected with spectropolarimetric measurements and are mapped with
Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). However, due to the cancellation of opposite
field polarities, polarimetry captures only a tiny fraction of the magnetic
flux and cannot assess the overall stellar surface magnetic field if it is
dominated by a small-scale component. Analysis of Zeeman broadening in
high-resolution intensity spectra can reveal these hidden complex magnetic
fields. Historically, there were very few attempts to obtain such measurements
for G dwarf stars due to the difficulty of disentangling Zeeman effect from
other broadening mechanisms affecting spectral lines. Here we developed a new
magnetic field diagnostic method based on relative Zeeman intensification of
optical atomic lines with different magnetic sensitivity. Using this technique
we obtained 78 field strength measurements for 15 Sun-like stars, including
some of the best-studied young solar twins. We find that the average magnetic
field strength $Bf$ drops from 1.3-2.0 kG in stars younger than about 120 Myr
to 0.2-0.8 kG in older stars. The mean field strength shows a clear correlation
with the Rossby number and with the coronal and chromospheric emission
indicators. Our results suggest that magnetic regions have roughly the same
local field strength $B\approx3.2$ kG in all stars, with the filling factor $f$
of these regions systematically increasing with stellar activity. Comparing our
results with the spectropolarimetric analyses of global magnetic fields in the
same stars, we find that ZDI recovers about 1% of the total magnetic field
energy in the most active stars. This figure drops to just 0.01% for the least
active targets.

present transit spectroscopy observations of HD 209458b using the HARPS-N and

radial velocity data from both instruments (nine transits in total), measuring
a projected spin-orbit angle of $-1.6\pm0.3~{\rm deg}$. We also present the
analysis of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy around the NaI region at

can be explained by the combination of the centre-to-limb variation and the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This is also observed in the time-evolution maps
and transmission light curves, but at lower signal-to-noise ratio. Other strong
lines such as H$\alpha$, CaII IRT, the MgI triplet region, and KI D1 are
analysed, and are also consistent with the modelled effects, without

  epoch analysis","  Magnetic clouds (MCs) are large-scale interplanetary transient structures in
the heliosphere that travel from the Sun into the interplanetary medium. The
internal magnetic field lines inside the MCs are twisted, forming a flux rope
(FR). This magnetic field structuring is determined by its initial solar
configuration, by the processes involved during its eruption from the Sun, and
by the dynamical evolution during its interaction with the ambient solar wind.
One of the most important properties of the magnetic structure inside MCs is
the twist of the field lines forming the FR (the number of turns per unit
length). The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly
because the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft
trajectory, and thus it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical
assumptions. Estimating the twist from the study of a single event is difficult
because the field fluctuations significantly increase the noise of the observed
B time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist. The superposed epoch
applied to MCs has proven to be a powerful technique, permitting the extraction
of their common features, and removing the peculiarity of individual cases. We
apply a superposed epoch technique to analyse the magnetic components in the
local FR frame of a significant sample of moderately asymmetric MCs observed at
1 au. From the superposed profile of B components in the FR frame, we determine
the typical twist distribution in MCs. The twist is nearly uniform in the FR
core (central half part), and it increases moderately, up to a factor two,
towards the MC boundaries. This profile is close to the Lundquist field model
limited to the FR core where the axial field component is above about one-third

induced by a high rate of mass accretion during a dwarf nova outburst, i.e.,
the X-rays originate from the surface of the hydrogen-burning WD whereas the
$V/I$ photons are from the irradiated disk. Our model explains the main
observational properties of ASASSN-16oh. We also obtained thermonuclear runaway
models with no mass ejection for a wide range of parameters of the WD mass and
mass accretion rates including both natural and forced novae in low-metal
environments of $Z=0.001$ and $Z=0.0001$. They are a new type of periodic
supersoft X-ray sources with no mass ejection, and also a bright transient in
$V$/$I$ bands if they have a large disk. We suggest that such objects are
candidates of Type Ia supernova progenitors because its mass is increasing at a
very high efficiency $(\sim 100 \%)$.

dust grain surfaces was studied experimentally by annealing neon-ice matrices
in which potential precursors of silicate grains (Mg and Fe atoms, SiO and
SiO$_2$ molecules) and of solid carbon (C$_n$ molecules, $n$ = 2-10) were
initially isolated. Other molecules, mainly O$_3$, CO, CO$_2$, C$_3$O, and
H$_2$O, were embedded at the same time in the matrices. The annealing procedure
caused the cold dopants to diffuse and interact in the neon ice. Monitoring the
procedure in situ with infrared spectroscopy revealed the disappearance of the
silicon oxide and carbon molecules at temperatures lower than 13 K, and the
rise of the Si-O stretching band of silicates. Ex situ electron microscopy
confirmed the formation of silicate grains and showed that their structure was
amorphous. It also showed that amorphous carbon matter was formed
simultaneously next to the silicate grains, the two materials being chemically
separated. The results of the experiments support the hypothesis that grains of
complex silicates and of carbonaceous materials are re-formed in the cold ISM,
as suggested by astronomical observations and evolution models of cosmic dust
masses. Moreover, they show that the potential precursors of one material do
not combine with those of the other at cryogenic temperatures, providing us
with a clue as to the separation of silicates and carbon in interstellar
grains.

scalar field is investigated in background of $(D+1)$-dimensional Milne
universe, assuming that the field obeys Robin boundary condition on the sphere.
The normalized mode functions are derived for the regions inside and outside

the Hadamard function is decomposed into boundary-free and sphere-induced
contributions and an integral representation is obtained for the latter in both
the interior and exterior regions. As important local characteristics of the
vacuum state the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the field squared and of
the energy-momentum tensor are investigated. It is shown that the vacuum
energy-momentum tensor has an off-diagonal component that corresponds to the
energy flux along the radial direction. Depending on the coefficient in Robin
boundary condition the sphere-induced contribution to the vacuum energy and the
energy flux can be either positive or negative. At late stages of the expansion
and for a massive field the decay of the sphere-induced VEVs, as functions of
time, is damping oscillatory. The geometry under consideration is conformally
related to that for a static spacetime with negative constant curvature space
and the sphere-induced contributions in the corresponding VEVs are compared.

exhibit pronounced plate-shaped morphologies. Using a phase-field model, we
investigate various influencing factors that determine the equilibrium shapes
of $\gamma""$ precipitates, minimizing the sum of the total elastic and
interfacial energy. Upon increasing precipitate phase fractions, the model
predicts increasingly stronger particle-particle interactions, leading to
shapes with significantly increased aspect ratios. Matching the a priori
unknown interfacial energy density to fit experimental $\gamma""$ shapes is
sensitive to the phase content imposed in the underlying model. Considering
vanishing phase content leads to 30% lower estimates of the interfacial energy
density, as compared to estimates based on realistic phase fractions of 12%. We
consider the periodic arrangement of precipitates in different hexagonal and
rectangular superstructures, which result from distinct choices of
point-symmetric and periodic boundary conditions. Further, non-volume
conserving boundary conditions are implemented to compensate for strains due to
an anisotropic lattice mismatch between the $\gamma$ matrix and the $\gamma''$
precipitate. As compared to conventional boundary conditions, this specifically
tailored simulation configuration does not conflict with the systems
periodicity and provides substantially more realistic total elastic energies at
high precipitate volume fractions. The energetically most favorable

two different space-time geometries. In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

distance and geodesic expansion) due to a momentum dependence of the metric in
the cotangent bundle. Also, we will see that when the spacetime considered is a

different energies, differently from a Lorentz invariance violation case.
However, the surface gravity computed as the peeling off of null geodesics is

brightness. Such variations have been extensively studied for the Sun. Recent
planet-hunting space telescopes allowed measuring brightness variations in
hundred thousands of other stars. The new data posed the question of how
typical is the Sun as a variable star. Putting solar variability into the
stellar context suffers, however, from the bias of solar observations being
made from its near-equatorial plane, whereas stars are observed at all possible
inclinations. We model solar brightness variations at timescales from days to
years as they would be observed at different inclinations. In particular, we
consider the effect of the inclination on the power spectrum of solar
brightness variations. The variations are calculated in several passbands
routinely used for stellar measurements. We employ the Surface Flux Transport
Model (SFTM) to simulate the time-dependent spatial distribution of magnetic
features on both near- and far-sides of the Sun. This distribution is then used
to calculate solar brightness variations following the SATIRE (Spectral And
Total Irradiance REconstruction) approach. We have quantified the effect of the
inclination on solar brightness variability at timescales down to a day. Thus,
our results allow making solar brightness records directly comparable to those
obtained by the planet-hunting space telescopes. Furthermore, we decompose
solar brightness variations into the components originating from the solar
rotation and from the evolution of magnetic features.

exoplanets orbiting nearby M dwarfs. One of the most promising candidates is
the late M dwarf system TRAPPIST-1 which has seven known transiting planets for
which Transit Timing Variation (TTV) measurements suggest that they are
terrestrial in nature, with a possible enrichment in volatiles. Among these
seven planets, TRAPPIST-1e seems to be the most promising candidate to have
habitable surface conditions, receiving ~66 % of the Earth's incident
radiation, and thus needing only modest greenhouse gas inventories to raise
surface temperatures to allow surface liquid water to exist. TRAPPIST-1e is
therefore one of the prime targets for JWST atmospheric characterization. In
this context, the modeling of its potential atmosphere is an essential step
prior to observation. Global Climate Models (GCMs) offer the most detailed way
to simulate planetary atmospheres. However, intrinsic differences exist between
GCMs which can lead to different climate prediction and thus observability of
gas and/or cloud features in transmission and thermal emission spectra. Such
differences should preferably be known prior to observations. In this paper we
present a protocol to inter-compare planetary GCMs. Four testing cases are
considered for TRAPPIST-1e but the methodology is applicable to other rocky
exoplanets in the Habitable Zone. The four test cases included two land planets
composed with a modern Earth and pure CO2 atmospheres, respectively, and two
aqua planets with the same atmospheric compositions. Currently, there are four
participating models (LMDG, ROCKE-3D, ExoCAM, UM), however this protocol is
intended to let other teams participate as well.

Epsilon Eridani (440 Myr), one of the youngest solar-like stars with a known
chromospheric CaII cycle. By analyzing the most recent Mount Wilson S-index
CaII data of this star, we found that the chromospheric cycle lasts 2.92 +/-
0.02 yr, in agreement with past results. From the long-term X-ray lightcurve,
we find clear and systematic X-ray variability of our target, consistent with
the chromospheric CaII cycle. The average X-ray luminosity results to be 2 x
10^28 erg/s, with an amplitude that is only a factor 2 throughout the cycle. We
apply a new method to describe the evolution of the coronal emission measure
distribution of Epsilon Eridani in terms of solar magnetic structures: active
regions, cores of active regions and flares covering the stellar surface at
varying filling fractions. Combinations of these magnetic structures can
describe the observed X-ray emission measure of Epsilon Eridani only if the
solar flare emission measure distribution is restricted to events in the decay
phase. The interpretation is that flares in the corona of Epsilon Eridani last
longer than their solar counterparts. We ascribe this to the lower metallicity
of Epsilon Eridani. Our analysis revealed also that the X-ray cycle of Epsilon
Eridani is strongly dominated by cores of active regions. The coverage fraction
of cores throughout the cycle changes by the same factor as the X-ray
luminosity. The maxima of the cycle are characterized by a high percentage of
covering fraction of the flares, consistent with the fact that flaring events
are seen in the corresponding short-term X-ray lightcurves predominately at the
cycle maxima. The high X-ray emission throughout the cycle of Epsilon Eridani
is thus explained by the high percentage of magnetic structures on its surface.

Universe. Their efficient gravitational settling and low effective temperatures
are responsible for the smooth spectra they exhibit. For that reason, it is not
possible to derive their radial velocities or to find the chemistry of the
progenitors. The best that can be done is to infer such properties from
associated sources, which are coeval. The simplest form of such a system is a
common proper motion pair where one star is an evolved degenerate and the other
a main-sequence star. In this work, we present the discovery of the first of
such a system, the M dwarf LHS 6328 and the ultra-cool white dwarf PSO
J1801+625, from the Pan-STARRS 1 3$\pi$ survey and the $Gaia$ Data Release 2.
Follow-up spectra were collected covering a usable wavelength range of

temperature of 3550K and surface gravity of $\log g = 7.45 \pm 0.13$ or $\log g
= 7.49 \pm 0.13$ for a CO or He core, respectively, when compared against

  physical parameters of intervening clouds","  This paper tries to establish whether there are variations of the central
wavelengths or the profile shapes of diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) and
whether these variations are caused by different physical parameters of
translucent clouds.
  For this purpose we used spectra of two stars seen through two different
single clouds: HD34078 (AE Aur) \& HD73882 acquired using
  two different instruments: the MIKE spectrograph, fed with the 6.5 m Magellan
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, and the UVES, fed with the 8 m Kueyen
telescope at the Paranal observatory. The wavelength displacements of the DIBs
at 6196, 6203, 6376, 6379 and 6614 \AA\ with respect to the well known
interstellar atomic and molecular lines (K{\sc i} and CH) have been measured.
The mentioned shift is seemingly absent in the DIBs at 4726, 4964, 4763, and
4780 \AA. In addition the considered profiles may show (in HD34078) extended
red wings. The observed phenomena are likely related to physical parameters of
intervening clouds (rotational temperatures of molecular species) and may help
in the identification of the DIB carriers.

2002.11034v1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,"Lying on networks: The role of structure and topology in promoting
  honesty","  Lies can have a negating impact on governments, companies, and the society as
a whole. Understanding the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance
across different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in
well-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely
well-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by
networks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution
of lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks,
systematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and
one-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to
the receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on
networks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to
evolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for
the receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world
networks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the
receiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show
that honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed
populations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the
one-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when
the cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly,
for lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto
white lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of
lying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than
the benefit for the receiver. In this case again the small-world topology acts
as an amplifier of the effect, while other network topologies fail to do the
same.

2002.11116v1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,EUCLIA. II. On the puzzling large UV to X-ray lags in Seyfert galaxies,"  Recent intense X-ray and UV monitoring campaigns with Swift have detected
clear UV lags behind X-ray in several local active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The
UV to X-ray lags are often larger (by a factor up to ~ 20) than expected if the
UV variation is simply due to the X-ray reprocessing. We previously developed a
model in which the UV/optical variations are attributed to disk turbulences,
and the effect of large-scale turbulence is considered. Our model, which
overcomes many severe challenges to the reprocessing scheme, can well explain
the observed variations in NGC 5548, particularly the correlations and lags
among the UV/optical bands. In this work, assuming the corona heating is
associated with turbulences in the inner accretion disk, we extend our study to
model the correlations and lags between the X-ray and UV/optical bands. We find
that our model, without the need of light echoing, can well reproduce the
observed UV to X-ray lags and the optical to UV lags simultaneously in four
local Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 4151, NGC 4395, NGC 4593, and NGC 5548.
In our scenario, relatively larger UV to X-ray lag is expected for AGN with
smaller innermost disk radius and thus more compact corona. Interestingly, for
these Seyfert galaxies studied in this work, sources with relatively larger UV
to X-ray lags do have broader Fe Ka lines, indicative of relativistic
broadening due to more compact corona and smaller innermost disk radius. If
confirmed with more X-ray and UV monitoring campaigns, this interesting
discovery would provide a new probe to the inner disk/corona.

2002.11122v1,2020-02-25,2020-02-25,"The effect of the environment-dependent IMF on the formation and
  metallicities of stars over the cosmic history","  Recent observational and theoretical studies indicate that the stellar
initial mass function (IMF) varies systematically with the environment (star
formation rate - SFR, metallicity). Although the exact dependence of the IMF on
those properties is likely to change with improving observational constraints,
the reported trend in the shape of the IMF appears robust. We present the first
study aiming to evaluate the effect of the IMF variations on the measured
cosmic SFR density (SFRD) as a function of metallicity and redshift, $f_{\rm
SFR}$(Z,z). We also study the expected number and metallicity of white dwarf,
neutron star and black hole progenitors under different IMF assumptions.
Applying the empirically driven IMF variations described by the integrated
galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory, we correct $f_{\rm SFR}$(Z,z) obtained by
Chruslinska & Nelemans (2019) and find lower SFRD at high redshifts as well as
a higher fraction of metal-poor stars being formed. In the local Universe, our
calculation applying the IGIMF theory suggests more white dwarf and neutron
star progenitors in comparison with the universal IMF scenario, while the
number of black hole progenitors remains unaffected.

  signatures from the explosion and companion interaction","  Growing evidence suggests that Type Iax supernovae might be the result of
thermonuclear deflagrations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in binary
systems. We carry out Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations and predict
spectropolarimetric features originating from the supernova explosion and
subsequent ejecta interaction with the companion star. Specifically, we
calculate viewing-angle dependent flux and polarisation spectra for a 3D model
simulating the deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and, for a
second model, simulating the ejecta interaction with a main-sequence star. We
find that the intrinsic signal is weakly polarised and only mildly
viewing-angle dependent, owing to the overall spherical symmetry of the
explosion and the depolarising contribution of iron-group elements dominating
the ejecta composition. The interaction with the companion star carves out a
cavity in the ejecta and produces a detectable, but modest signal that is
significant only at relatively blue wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 5000
$\unicode{x212B}$). In particular, increasingly fainter and redder spectra are
predicted for observer orientations further from the cavity, while a modest
polarisation signal $P\sim0.2$ per cent is found at blue wavelengths for
orientations 30$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$ away from the cavity. We find a
reasonable agreement between the interaction model viewed from these
orientations and spectropolarimetric data of SN 2005hk and interpret the
maximum-light polarisation signal seen at blue wavelengths for this event as a
possible signature of the ejecta-companion interaction. We encourage further
polarimetric observations of SNe Iax to test whether our results can be
extended and generalised to the whole SN Iax class.

using the Israel junction condition. We found that if the Higgs field develops
the second minimum at higher energy scale, a spinning small-mass naked
singularity could cause the vacuum decay around it within the cosmic age. An
event horizon may form around the singularity due to the angular momentum
transport from the singularity to a vacuum bubble wall. The newly formed event
horizon leads to the increase of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which contributes
to the enhancement of the vacuum decay rate. We conclude that small-mass naked
singularities may be hidden by the event horizon within the cosmological time.

flammability hazards and large databases of measured values exist, although
millions of compounds remain unmeasured. To rapidly extend existing data to new
compounds many researchers have used quantitative structure-property
relationship (QSPR) analysis to effectively predict flash points. In recent
years graph-based deep learning (GBDL) has emerged as a powerful alternative
method to traditional QSPR. In this paper, GBDL models were implemented in
predicting flash point for the first time. We assessed the performance of two
GBDL models, message-passing neural network (MPNN) and graph convolutional
neural network (GCNN), by comparing methods. Our result shows that MPNN both
outperforms GCNN and yields slightly worse but comparable performance with
previous QSPR studies. The average R2 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) scores of
MPNN are, respectively, 2.3% lower and 2.0 K higher than previous comparable
studies. To further explore GBDL models, we collected the largest flash point
dataset to date, which contains 10575 unique molecules. The optimized MPNN
gives a test data R2 of 0.803 and MAE of 17.8 K on the complete dataset. We
also extracted 5 datasets from our integrated dataset based on molecular types
(acids, organometallics, organogermaniums, organosilicons, and organotins) and

inconsistency of five standard deviations. To determine the masses of the
lightest ions with a relative precision of a few parts per trillion and
investigate this mass problem a cryogenic multi-Penning trap setup, LIONTRAP

the GBM GRB catalog series is to provide updated information to the community
on the most important observables of the GBM-detected GRBs. For each GRB the
location and main characteristics of the prompt emission, the duration, peak
flux, and fluence are derived. The latter two quantities are calculated for the
50-300 keV energy band, where the maximum energy release of GRBs in the
instrument reference system is observed and also for a broader energy band from
10-1000 keV, exploiting the full energy range of GBM's low-energy detectors.
Furthermore, information is given on the settings of the triggering criteria
and exceptional operational conditions during years 7 to 10 in the mission.
This fourth catalog is an official product of the Fermi-GBM science team, and
the data files containing the complete results are available from the

Using spectroscopic measurements of 5 stars, we obtain a constraint on the
relative variation of the fine structure constant below $10^{-5}$. This is the
first time a varying constant of Nature is searched for around a black hole and

2002.11645v1,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,Facebook Ads as a Demographic Tool to Measure the Urban-Rural Divide,"  In the global move toward urbanization, making sure the people remaining in
rural areas are not left behind in terms of development and policy
considerations is a priority for governments worldwide. However, it is
increasingly challenging to track important statistics concerning this sparse,
geographically dispersed population, resulting in a lack of reliable,
up-to-date data. In this study, we examine the usefulness of the Facebook
Advertising platform, which offers a digital ""census"" of over two billions of
its users, in measuring potential rural-urban inequalities. We focus on Italy,
a country where about 30% of the population lives in rural areas. First, we
show that the population statistics that Facebook produces suffer from
instability across time and incomplete coverage of sparsely populated
municipalities. To overcome such limitation, we propose an alternative
methodology for estimating Facebook Ads audiences that nearly triples the
coverage of the rural municipalities from 19% to 55% and makes feasible
fine-grained sub-population analysis. Using official national census data, we
evaluate our approach and confirm known significant urban-rural divides in
terms of educational attainment and income. Extending the analysis to
Facebook-specific user ""interests"" and behaviors, we provide further insights
on the divide, for instance, finding that rural areas show a higher interest in
gambling. Notably, we find that the most predictive features of income in rural
areas differ from those for urban centres, suggesting researchers need to
consider a broader range of attributes when examining rural wellbeing. The
findings of this study illustrate the necessity of improving existing tools and
methodologies to include under-represented populations in digital demographic
studies -- the failure to do so could result in misleading observations,
conclusions, and most importantly, policies.

  oscillating Ap star HD 166473","  How magnetic fields contribute to the differentiation of the rotation rates
of the Ap stars and affect the occurrence of non-radial pulsation in some of
them are important open questions. Valuable insight can be gained into these
questions by studying some of the most extreme examples of the processes at
play. The super-slowly rotating rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star HD 166473 is
such an example. We performed the first accurate determination of its rotation
period, (3836 +/- 30)d, from the analysis of 56 measurements of the mean
magnetic field modulus <B> based on high-resolution spectra acquired between
1992 and 2019 at various observatories and with various instrumental
configurations. We complemented this analysis with the consideration of an
inhomogeneous set of 21 determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field
<B_z> spanning the same time interval. This makes HD 166473 one of only four Ap
stars with a period longer than 10 years for which magnetic field measurements
have been obtained over more than a full cycle. The variation curves of <B> and
of <B_z> are well approximated by cosine waves. The magnetic field of HD 166473
only seems to deviate slightly from axisymmetry, but it definitely involves a
considerable non-dipolar component. Among the stars with rotation periods
longer than 1000 d for which magnetic field measurements with full phase
coverage are available, HD 166473 has the strongest field. Its magnetic field
is also one of the strongest known among roAp stars. Overall, the magnetic
properties of HD 166473 do not seem fundamentally distinct from those of the
faster-rotating Ap stars. However, considering as a group the eight Ap stars
that have accuractely determined periods longer than 1000 d and whose magnetic
variations have been characterised over a full cycle suggests that the angles
between their magnetic and rotation axes tend to be systematically large.

  loops","  Phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves has been studied extensively as a possible
coronal heating mechanism but without the full thermodynamic consequences
considered self-consistently. It has been argued that in some cases, the
thermodynamic feedback of the heating could substantially affect the transverse
density gradient and even inhibit the phase mixing process. In this paper, we
use MHD simulations with the appropriate thermodynamical terms included to
quantify the evaporation following heating by phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves in
a coronal loop and the effect of this evaporation on the transverse density
profile. The numerical simulations were performed using the Lare2D code. We set
up a 2D loop model consisting of a field-aligned thermodynamic equilibrium and
a cross-field (background) heating profile. A continuous, sinusoidal,
high-frequency Alfv\'en wave driver was implemented. As the Alfv\'en waves
propagate along the field, they undergo phase mixing due to the cross-field
density gradient in the coronal part of the loop. We investigated the presence
of field-aligned flows, heating from the dissipation of the phase-mixed
Alfv\'en waves, and the subsequent evaporation from the lower atmosphere. We
find that phase mixing of Alfv\'en waves leads to modest heating in the shell
regions of the loop and evaporation of chromospheric material into the corona
with upflows of the order of only 5-20 m/s. Although the evaporation leads to a
mass increase in the shell regions of the loop, the effect on the density
gradient and, hence, on the phase mixing process, is insignificant. This paper
self-consistently investigates the effect of chromospheric evaporation on the
cross-field density gradient and the phase mixing process in a coronal loop. We
found that the effects in our particular setup (small amplitude, high frequency
waves) are too small to significantly change the density gradient.

the catalytic activity of Pt when it was injected into the electrolyte.
However, it blocked the oxygen reduction reaction when it was premixed with the
catalyst. Proton transport was not blocked in either case. We postulate that
di-phenyl siloxane induces hydrophobicity and causes local water starvation
thereby blocking oxygen transport. Hence, the slow leaching of silicone seals
in a fuel cell could cause silicon accumulation in the electrode, which will
irreversibly degrade fuel cell performance by blocking oxygen transport to the
catalyst sites.

extrasolar planet studies because of its relevance in the estimation of the
global planet population of our galaxy and the clues it can give to our
understanding of planet formation and evolution. Multiple stars have often been
excluded from exoplanet searches, especially those performed using the radial
velocity technique, due to the technical challenges posed by such targets. As a
consequence and despite recent efforts, our knowledge of the frequency of
planets in multiple stellar systems is still rather incomplete. On the other
hand, the lack of knowledge about the binarity at the time of the compilation
of the target samples means that our estimate of the planet frequency around
single stars could be tainted by the presence of unknown binaries, especially
if these objects have a different behavior in terms of planet occurrence. In a
previous work we investigated the binarity of the objects included in the
Uniform Detectability sample defined by Fisher and Valenti (2005), showing how
more than 20% of their targets were, in fact, not single stars. Here, we
present an update of this census, made possible mainly by the information now
available thanks to the second Gaia Data Release. The new binary sample
includes a total of 313 systems, of which 114 were added through this work. We
were also able to significantly improve the estimates of masses and orbital
parameters for most of the pairs in the original list, especially those at
close separations. A few new systems with white dwarf companions were also
identified. The results of the new analysis are in good agreement with the
findings of our previous work, confirming the lack of difference in the overall
planet frequency between binaries and single stars but suggesting a decrease in
the planet frequency for very close pairs.}

filaments have been interpreted as signs of gas accreting onto and along these
filaments, potentially feeding star-forming cores and proto-clusters. The
behavior of velocity gradients in filaments, however, has not been studied in
detail, particularly on small scales (< 0.1 pc). In this paper, we present
MUFASA, an efficient, robust, and automatic method to fit ammonia lines with
multiple velocity components, generalizable to other molecular species. We also
present CRISPy, a Python package to identify filament spines in 3D images
(e.g., position-position-velocity cubes), along with a complementary technique
to sort fitted velocity components into velocity-coherent filaments. In NGC
1333, we find a wealth of velocity gradient structures on a beam-resolved scale
of ~0.05 pc. Interestingly, these local velocity gradients are not randomly
oriented with respect to filament spines and their perpendicular, i.e., radial,
component decreases in magnitude towards the spine for many filaments. Together
with remarkably constant velocity gradients on larger scales along many
filaments, these results suggest a scenario in which gas falling onto filaments
is progressively damped and redirected to flow along these filaments.

multiscale deformation patterns. Revealing the organizing principles of this
spatial complexity has ramifications for our understanding of morphogenetic
processes in plant leaves and animal epithelia, and perhaps even the formation
of human fingerprints. We elucidate a primary source of this morphological
complexity - an incompatibility between an elastically-favored
""micro-structure"" of uniformly spaced wrinkles and a ""macro-structure"" imparted
through the wrinkle director and dictated by confinement forces. Our theory is
borne out of experiments and simulations of floating sheets subjected to radial
stretching. By analyzing patterns of grossly radial wrinkles we find two
sharply distinct morphologies: defect-free patterns with a fixed number of
wrinkles and non-uniform spacing, and patterns of uniformly spaced wrinkles
separated by defect-rich buffer zones. We show how these morphological types
reflect distinct minima of a Ginzburg-Landau functional - a coarse-grained
version of the elastic energy, which penalizes nonuniform wrinkle spacing and
amplitude, as well as deviations of their actual director from the axis imposed
by confinement. Our results extend the effective description of wrinkle
patterns as liquid crystals (H. Aharoni et al., Nat. Commun. 8:15809, 2017),
and we highlight a fascinating analogy between the geometry-energy interplay
that underlies the proliferation of defects in the mechanical equilibrium of

measured using a laser-optics based curvature setup, whereas glancing angle
X-ray diffraction was employed to quantify the surface stress; this also
allowed studying role of out-of-plane stress gradient in whisker growth. Both
bulk stress and surface stress in Sn coating evolved with time, wherein both
were compressive immediately after the deposition, and thereafter while the
bulk stress monotonically became more compressive and subsequently saturated
with aging at room temperature, the stress near the surface of the Sn coating
continually became more tensile with aging. These opposing evolutionary
behaviors of bulk and surface stresses readily established a negative
out-of-plane stress gradient, required for spontaneous growth of whiskers. The
importance of out-of-plane stress gradient was also validated by externally
imposing widely different stress states and stress gradients in Sn coatings
using a 3-point bending apparatus. It was consistently observed that whisker
growth was more in the coatings under external tensile stress, however, with
higher negative out-of-plane stress gradient. The results conclusively indicate

linear residual thermal conductivity, $\kappa_0/T \equiv \kappa/T (T

low-temperature thermal conductivity strongly depends on the cooling process of
the sample. When cooling down very slowly, a sizable $\kappa_0/T$ is observed.
In contrast, when cooling down rapidly, $\kappa_0/T$ vanishes and, in addition,
the phonon thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed. These results suggest
that possible random scatterers introduced during the cooling process are
responsible for the apparent discrepancy of the thermal conductivity data in
this organic system. The present results provide evidence that the true ground

Exclusive parallel momentum distributions for states in the neutron-deficient

reaction theory and shell-model calculations. For the well-known $^{22}$Mg and

the dependence of the parallel momentum distribution width on the angular

level at 3439(9) keV, of relevance for the important
$^{23}$Al(p,$\gamma$)$^{24}$Si astrophysical reaction rate, was confirmed to be
the $2^+_2$ state, while the $4^+_1$ state, expected to be strongly populated
in two-neutron knockout, was not observed. This puzzle is resolved by
theoretical considerations of the Thomas-Ehrman shift, which also suggest that

2002.11897v1,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,Missing water in Class I protostellar disks,"  Water is a key volatile that provides insights into the initial stages of
planet formation. The low water abundances inferred from water observations
toward low-mass protostellar objects may point to a rapid locking of water as
ice by large dust grains during star and planet formation. However, little is
known about the water vapor abundance in newly formed planet-forming disks. We
aim to determine the water abundance in embedded Keplerian disks through
spatially-resolved observations of H$_2^{18}$O lines to understand the
evolution of water during star and planet formation. We present H$_2^{18}$O
line observations with ALMA and NOEMA millimeter interferometers toward five
young stellar objects. NOEMA observed the 3$_{1,3}$ - $2_{2,0}$ line (E$_{\rm
up}$ = 203.7 K) while ALMA targeted the $4_{1,4}$ - $3_{2,1}$ line (E$_{\rm
up}$ = 322.0 K). Water column densities are derived considering optically thin
and thermalized emission. Our observations are sensitive to the emission from
the known Keplerian disks around three out of the five Class I objects in the
sample. No H$_2^{18}$O emission is detected toward any of our five Class I
disks. We report upper limits to the integrated line intensities. The inferred
water column densities in Class I disks are N < 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ on 100 au
scales which include both disk and envelope. The upper limits imply a
disk-averaged water abundance of $\lesssim 10^{-6}$ with respect to H$_2$ for
Class I objects. After taking into account the physical structure of the disk,
the upper limit to the water abundance averaged over the inner warm disk with
$T>$ 100 K is between 10$^{-7}$ up to 10$^{-5}$. Water vapor is not abundant in
warm protostellar envelopes around Class I protostars. Upper limits to the
water vapor column densities in Class I disks are at least two orders magnitude
lower than values found in Class 0 disk-like structures.

2002.11947v2,2020-02-27,2020-02-27,Shape model and spin state of non-principal axis rotator (5247) Krylov,"  Context. The study of non-principal axis (NPA) rotators can provide important
clues to the evolution of the spin state of asteroids. However, so far, very
few studies have focused on NPA-rotating main-belt asteroids (MBAs). One of
MBAs that are known to be in an excited rotation state is asteroid (5247)
Krylov. Aims. By using disk-integrated photometric data, we construct a
physical model of (5247) Krylov including shape and spin state. Methods. We
apply the light curve convex inversion method employing optical light curves
obtained by using ground-based telescopes in three apparitions during 2006,
2016, and 2017, along with infrared light curves obtained by the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite in 2010. Results. Asteroid
(5247)~Krylov is spinning in a short axis mode (SAM) characterized by rotation
and precession periods of 368.7 hr and 67.27 hr, respectively. The angular
momentum vector orientation of Krylov is found to be $\lambda_{L} = 298^\circ$
and $\beta_{L} = -58^\circ$. The ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the
basic spin state energy $E/E_{0} \simeq 1.02$ shows that the (5247) Krylov is
about 2% excited state compared to the Principal Axis (PA) rotation state. The
shape of (5247) Krylov can be approximated by an elongated prolate ellipsoid
with a ratio of moments of inertia of $I_{a}:I_{b}:I_{c}=0.36:0.96:1$. This is
the first physical model of NPA rotator among MBAs. The physical processes that
led to the current NPA rotation cannot be unambiguously reconstructed.

subadditivity being saturated. We then discuss an effective codim-1 envelope

investigate whether magnetars could also be produced from neutron star--white

By a preliminary calculation, we find that NSWD mergers with unstable mass

the dynamo mechanism due to differential rotation and convection or possibly
via the magnetic flux conservation scenario of a fossil field. If NSWD mergers
can indeed create magnetars, then such objects could produce at least a subset
of FRB 180924-like FRBs within the framework of flaring magnetars, since the
ejecta, local environments, and host galaxies of the final remnants from NSWD
mergers resemble those of BNS/BWD/AIC channels. This NSWD channel is also able
to well explain both the observational properties of FRB 180924-like and FRB

identify two mechanisms by which an applied magnetic field can induce a second

itself generally lifts the selection rules. In the Voigt configuration, an
additional magneto-Stark electric field appears. This also induces certain SHG
processes differing from those induced by the magnetic field alone.

decaying to $\Lambda\Lambda nn$ might exist in nature. Similarly, there is a
broad agreement about the nonexistence of $\Lambda\Lambda n$ bound states.
However, the coupling to $\Xi NN$ states opens the door to a resonance above
the $\Lambda\Lambda n$ threshold.

  Hydrogen Evolution Reaction","  Understanding the role of elastic strain in modifying catalytic reaction
rates is crucial for catalyst design, but experimentally, this effect is often
coupled with a ligand effect. To isolate the strain effect, we have
investigated the influence of externally applied elastic strain on the
catalytic activity of metal films towards the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER). We show that elastic strain tunes the catalytic activity in a controlled
and predictable way. Both theory and experiment show strain controls reactivity
in a controlled manner consistent with the qualitative predictions of the HER
volcano plot and the d-band theory: Ni and Pt activity were accelerated by
compression, while Cu activity was accelerated by tension. By isolating the
elastic strain effect from the ligand effect, this study provides a greater
insight into the role of elastic strain in controlling electrocatalytic
activity.

  materials/structures: A state-of-the-art review","  Composite materials/structures are advancing in product efficiency,
cost-effectiveness and the development of superior specific properties. There
are increasing demands in their applications to load-carrying structures in
aerospace, wind turbines, transportation, and medical equipment, etc. Thus
robust and reliable non-destructive testing (NDT) of composites is essential to
reduce safety concerns and maintenance costs. There have been various NDT
methods built upon different principles for quality assurance during the whole
lifecycle of a composite product. This paper reviews the most established NDT
techniques for detection and evaluation of defects/damage evolution in
composites. These include acoustic emission, ultrasonic testing, infrared
thermography, terahertz testing, shearography, digital image correlation, as
well as X-ray and neutron imaging. For each NDT technique, we cover a brief
historical background, principles, standard practices, equipment and facilities
used for composite research. We also compare and discuss their benefits and
limitations, and further summarise their capabilities and applications to
composite structures. Each NDT technique has its own potential and rarely
achieves a full-scale diagnosis of structural integrity. Future development of
NDT techniques for composites will be directed towards intelligent and
automated inspection systems with high accuracy and efficient data processing
capabilities.

coming from a particular direction. These time delays compensate for
differences in the time of arrival of the wavefront at the different elements
of the interferometer, and for delays in the instrument's signal chain. If the
radio interferometer is operated as a phased array (tied array), the time
delays cannot be accounted for after an observation, so they must be determined
in advance. Our aim is to characterize the time delays between the stations in
the core of the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We used radio holography to
determine the time delays for the core stations of LOFAR (innermost 3.5 km).
Using the multibeaming capability of LOFAR we map the voltage beam faster than
with a raster scan, while simultaneously calibrating the observed beam
continuously. For short radio holographic observations (60 s and 600 s) of
3C196, 3C147, and 3C48 we are able to derive time delays with errors of less
than one nanosecond. After applying the derived time delays to the beamformer,
the beam shows residuals of less than $20\%$ with respect to the theoretical
beam shape. Tied-array holography could be a way towards semi-real-time beam
calibration for the Square Kilometer Array.

from $e^+e^-\to {\rm (hadrons)}$ below the charm threshold rely on finite
energy sum rules (FESRs) where the experimental side is given by integrated
spectral function moments. Here we study the renormalons that appear in the
Borel transform of polynomial moments in the large-$\beta_0$ limit and in full
QCD. In large-$\beta_0$, we establish a direct connection between the
renormalons and the perturbative behaviour of moments often employed in the
literature. The leading IR singularity is particularly prominent and is behind
the fate of moments whose perturbative series are unstable, while those with
good perturbative behaviour benefit from partial cancellations of renormalon
singularities. The conclusions can be extended to QCD through a convenient
scheme transformation to the $C$-scheme together with the use of a modified
Borel transform which make the results particularly simple; the leading IR
singularity becomes a simple pole, as in large-$\beta_0$. Finally, for the
moments that display good perturbative behaviour, we discuss an optimized
truncation based on renormalisation scheme (or scale) variation. Our results
allow for a deeper understanding of the perturbative behaviour of integrated
spectral function moments and provide theoretical support for low-$Q^2$

depends on ranking because most users only view top-ranked comments. When
comments are ranked by an ordered score (e.g. number of replies or up-votes)
without adjusting for semantic similarity of near-ranked comments, top-ranked
comments are more likely to emphasize the majority opinion and incur
redundancy. In this paper, we propose a top K comment diversification
re-ranking model using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and evaluate its impact
in three categories: (1) semantic diversity, (2) inclusion of the semantics of
lower-ranked comments, and (3) redundancy, within the context of a HarvardX
course discussion forum. We conducted a double-blind, small-scale evaluation
experiment requiring subjects to select between the top 5 comments of a
diversified ranking and a baseline ranking ordered by score. For three
subjects, across 100 trials, subjects selected the diversified (75% score, 25%
diversification) ranking as significantly (1) more diverse, (2) more inclusive,
and (3) less redundant. Within each category, inter-rater reliability showed
moderate consistency, with typical Cohen-Kappa scores near 0.2. Our findings
suggest that our model improves (1) diversification, (2) inclusion, and (3)
redundancy, among top K ranked comments in online discussion forums.

with a single compact extra dimension, whether flat or warped. These scattering
amplitudes are characterized by intricate cancellations between different
contributions: although individual contributions may grow as fast as ${\cal
O}(s^5)$, the full results grow only as ${\cal O}(s)$. We demonstrate that the
cancellations persist for all incoming and outgoing particle helicities and
examine how truncating the computation to only include a finite number of
intermediate states impacts the accuracy of the results. We also carefully
assess the range of validity of the low energy effective Kaluza-Klein theory.
In particular, for the warped case we demonstrate directly how an emergent low
energy scale controls the size of the scattering amplitude, as conjectured by
the AdS/CFT correspondence.

  Camera","  We propose a robust method for estimating road curb 3D parameters (size,
location, orientation) using a calibrated monocular camera equipped with a
fisheye lens. Automatic curb detection and localization is particularly
important in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), i.e. to
prevent possible collision and damage of the vehicle's bumper during
perpendicular and diagonal parking maneuvers. Combining 3D geometric reasoning
with advanced vision-based detection methods, our approach is able to estimate
the vehicle to curb distance in real time with mean accuracy of more than 90%,
as well as its orientation, height and depth.
  Our approach consists of two distinct components - curb detection in each
individual video frame and temporal analysis. The first part comprises of
sophisticated curb edges extraction and parametrized 3D curb template fitting.
Using a few assumptions regarding the real world geometry, we can thus retrieve
the curb's height and its relative position w.r.t. the moving vehicle on which
the camera is mounted. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier fed with
Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used for appearance-based filtering
out outliers. In the second part, the detected curb regions are tracked in the
temporal domain, so as to perform a second pass of false positives rejection.
  We have validated our approach on a newly collected database of 11 videos
under different conditions. We have used point-wise LIDAR measurements and
manual exhaustive labels as a ground truth.

InAs/GaSb composite quantum wells (CQWs), host structures for quantum spin Hall
insulators, by transport measurements and eight-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$
calculations. Using different substrates and buffer layer structures for
crystal growth, we prepare two types of samples with vastly different strain
conditions. CQWs with a nearly strain-free GaSb layer exhibit a resistance peak
at the charge neutrality point that reflects the opening of a topological gap
in the band-inverted regime. In contrast, for CQWs with 0.50\% biaxial tensile
strain in the GaSb layer, semimetallic behavior indicating a gap closure is
found for the same degree of band inversion. Additionally, with the tensile
strain, the boundary between the topological and nontopological regimes is
located at a larger InAs thickness. Eight-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations
reveal that tensile strain in GaSb not only shifts the phase boundary but also
significantly modifies the band structure, which can result in the closure of
an indirect gap and make the system semimetallic even in the topological
regime. Our results thus provide a global picture of the
topological-nontopological phase diagram as a function of layer thicknesses and
strain.

the mass of a quantum soliton depend on a choice of matching condition for the
regulators of the vacuum and one-soliton sector Hamiltonians. In supersymmetric
theories, regulators which preserve supersymmetry yield the correct quantum
corrections, as these are dictated by supersymmetry. However, in a general
theory it is not known which matching condition yields the correct mass. We use
the leading term in the operator that creates the soliton to construct the
regulated one-soliton sector Hamiltonian from that of the vacuum sector,
providing the correct matching condition. As an application, we derive a simple
formula for the one-loop mass of a kink in a large class of 1+1 dimensional
scalar field theories and also, at one loop, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian
which describes the kink excitations.

observations are present both in magnetization and resistivity. Specifically,
we show that due to the periodic alignment between the Landau levels in the

oscillations so that the electronic structure oscillates with the magnetic
field. Our results explain main features of quantum oscillations observed in
experiments. They indicate that the non-rigidity of the electronic structure

2002.12525v1,2020-02-28,2020-02-28,An ALMA Survey of H$_2$CO in Protoplanetary Disks,"  H$_2$CO is one of the most abundant organic molecules in protoplanetary disks
and can serve as a precursor to more complex organic chemistry. We present an
ALMA survey of H$_2$CO towards 15 disks covering a range of stellar spectral
types, stellar ages, and dust continuum morphologies. H$_2$CO is detected
towards 13 disks and tentatively detected towards a 14th. We find both
centrally-peaked and centrally-depressed emission morphologies, and half of the
disks show ring-like structures at or beyond expected CO snowline locations.
Together these morphologies suggest that H$_2$CO in disks is commonly produced
through both gas-phase and CO-ice-regulated grain-surface chemistry. We extract
disk-averaged and azimuthally-averaged H$_2$CO excitation temperatures and
column densities for four disks with multiple H$_2$CO line detections. The
temperatures are between 20-50K, with the exception of colder temperatures in
the DM Tau disk. These temperatures suggest that H$_2$CO emission in disks is
generally emerging from the warm molecular layer, with some contributions from
the colder midplane. Applying the same H$_2$CO excitation temperatures to all
disks in the survey, we find that H$_2$CO column densities span almost three
orders of magnitude ($\sim 5 \times 10^{11} - 5 \times 10^{14}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). The column densities appear uncorrelated with disk size and
stellar age, but Herbig Ae disks may have less H$_2$CO compared to T Tauri
disks, possibly because of less CO freeze-out. More H$_2$CO observations
towards Herbig Ae disks are needed to confirm this tentative trend, and to
better constrain under which disk conditions H$_2$CO and other oxygen-bearing
organics efficiently form during planet formation.

linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence, so it is worthwhile
to define it in full detail. We present soundness and completeness proofs of a
sequent calculus for first-order logic, formalized in the interactive proof
assistant Isabelle/HOL. Our formalization is based on work by Stefan Berghofer,
which we have since updated to use Isabelle's declarative proof style Isar
(Archive of Formal Proofs, Entry FOL-Fitting, August 2007 / July 2018). We
represent variables with de Bruijn indices; this makes substitution under
quantifiers less intuitive for a human reader. However, the nature of natural
numbers yields an elegant solution when compared to implementations of
substitution using variables represented by strings. The sequent calculus
considered has the special property of an always empty antecedent and a list of
formulas in the succedent. We obtain the proofs of soundness and completeness
for the sequent calculus as a derived result of the inverse duality of its
tableau counterpart. We strive to not only present the results of the proofs of
soundness and completeness, but also to provide a deep dive into a
programming-like approach to the formalization of first-order logic syntax,

  The implementation of a competition between GATP would allow to create a test
bench for GATP developers to improve the existing ones and to propose new ones.
It would also allow to establish a ranking for GATP that could be used by
""clients"" (e.g. developers of educational e-learning systems) to choose the

  at short time scales","  The efficiency of the management of top-class ground-based astronomical
facilities supported by Adaptive Optics (AO) relies on our ability to forecast
the optical turbulence (OT) and a set of relevant atmospheric parameters.
Indeed, in spite of the fact that the AO is able to achieve, at present,
excellent levels of wavefront corrections (a Strehl Ratio up to 90% in H band),
its performances strongly depend on the atmospheric conditions. Knowing in
advance the turbulence conditions allows an optimization of the AO use. It has
already been proven that it is possible to provide reliable forecasts of the
optical turbulence (CN2 profiles and integrated astroclimatic parameters such
as seeing, isoplanantic angle, wavefront coherence time, ...) for the next
night. In this paper we prove that it is possible to improve the forecast
performances on shorter time scales (order of one or two hours) with consistent
gains (order of 2 to 8) using filtering techniques. This has permitted us to
achieve forecasts accuracies never obtained before and reach a fundamental
milestone for the astronomical applications. The time scale of one or two hours
is the most critical one for an efficient management of the ground-based
telescopes supported by AO. Results shown here open, therefore, to an important
revolution in the field. We implemented this method in the operational forecast
system of the Large Binocular Telescope, named ALTA Center that is, at our
knowledge, the first operational system providing forecasts of turbulence and
atmospheric parameters at short time scales to support science operations.

  of Star Formation in NGC 2264 with Gaia DR2","  Aims. To demonstrate that `INDICATE' is a powerful spatial analysis tool
which when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly
probe star formation history.
  Methods. We compared the dynamic & spatial distributions of young stellar
objects (YSOs) at various evolutionary stages in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper
motion data and INDICATE.
  Results. The dynamic & spatial behaviours of YSOs at different evolutionary
stages are distinct. Dynamically, Class II YSOs predominately have non-random
trajectories that are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class III
YSOs have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns.
Spatially, there is a correlation between the evolutionary stage and source
concentration: 69.4% of Class 0/I, 27.9% of Class II, and 7.7% of Class III
objects are found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered with
objects of the same class also follows this trend. Class 0/I objects are both
found to be more tightly clustered with the general populous/objects of the
same class than Class IIs and IIIs by a factor of 1.2/4.1 and 1.9/6.6,
respectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05deg of S Mon where
Class III objects mimic the behaviours of Class II sources across the wider
cluster region. Our results suggest (i) current YSOs distributions are a result
of dynamical evolution, (ii) prolonged star formation has been occurring
sequentially, and (iii) stellar feedback from S Mon is causing YSOs to appear
as more evolved sources.
  Conclusions. Designed to provide a quantitative measure of clustering
behaviours, INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial
analyses. Our findings are consistent with what is known about NGC 2264,
effectively demonstrating that when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2
INDICATE can be used to robustly study the star formation history of a cluster.

2002.12692v1,2020-02-28,2020-02-28,[CII] 158 μm self-absorption and optical depth effects,"  Context. The [CII] 158 {\mu}m far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure line is one
of the most important cooling lines of the star-forming interstellar medium
(ISM). High spectral resolution observations have shown complex structures in
the line profiles of the [CII] emission. Aims. Our aim is to determine whether
the complex profiles observed in [^{12}CII] are due to individual velocity
components along the line-of-sight or to self-absorption based on a comparison
of the [^{12}CII] and isotopic [^{13}CII] line profiles. Methods. Deep
integrations with the SOFIA/upGREAT 7-pixel array receiver in M43,
Horsehead~PDR, Monoceros~R2, and M17~SW allow for the detection of optically
thin [^{13}CII] emission lines, along with the [^{12}CII] emission lines, with
a high signal-to-noise ratio. We first derived the [^{12}CII] optical depth and
the [CII] column density from a single component model. However, the complex
line profiles observed require a double layer model with an emitting background
and an absorbing foreground. A multi-component velocity fit allows us to derive
the physical conditions of the [CII] gas: column density and excitation
temperature. Results. We find moderate to high [^{12}CII] optical depths in all
four sources and self-absorption of [^{12}CII] in Mon R2 and M17 SW. The high
column density of the warm background emission corresponds to an equivalent Av
of up to 41 mag. The foreground absorption requires substantial column
densities of cold and dense [CII] gas, with an equivalent Av ranging up to
about 13 mag. Conclusions. The column density of the warm background material
requires multiple photon-dominated region (PDR) surfaces stacked along the line
of sight and in velocity. The substantial column density of dense and cold
foreground [CII] gas detected in absorption cannot be explained with any known
scenario and we can only speculate on its origins

within a region of $\Delta{}SGL = 30^\circ$ and $\Delta{}SGB = 20^\circ$ around

dispersions, we made an estimate for the virial mass of the Virgo cluster.
  Results. We identify the infall of galaxies towards the Virgo cluster core

we obtain the virial mass estimate of $(6.3\pm0.9) \times 10^{14} M_\odot, $

was proposed. The idea of proposing this algorithm belongs to the hunting
behavior of the humpback whale. However, WOA suffers from poor performance in
the exploitation phase and stagnates in the local best solution. Grey Wolf
Optimization (GWO) is a very competitive algorithm comparing to other common
metaheuristic algorithms as it has a super performance in the exploitation
phase while it is tested on unimodal benchmark functions. Therefore, the aim of
this paper is to hybridize GWO with WOA to overcome the problems. GWO can
perform well in exploiting optimal solutions. In this paper, a hybridized WOA
with GWO which is called WOAGWO is presented. The proposed hybridized model
consists of two steps. Firstly, the hunting mechanism of GWO is embedded into
the WOA exploitation phase with a new condition which is related to GWO.
Secondly, a new technique is added to the exploration phase to improve the
solution after each iteration. Experimentations are tested on three different
standard test functions which are called benchmark functions: 23 common
functions, 25 CEC2005 functions and 10 CEC2019 functions. The proposed WOAGWO
is also evaluated against original WOA, GWO and three other commonly used
algorithms. Results show that WOAGWO outperforms other algorithms depending on
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Finally, WOAGWO is likewise applied to solve an
engineering problem such as pressure vessel design. Then the results prove that

information about real-world entities. Understanding the uniqueness of each
entity is crucial to the analyzing, sharing, and reusing of KGs. Traditional
profiling technologies encompass a vast array of methods to find distinctive
features in various applications, which can help to differentiate entities in
the process of human understanding of KGs. In this work, we present a novel
profiling approach to identify distinctive entity features. The distinctiveness
of features is carefully measured by a HAS model, which is a scalable
representation learning model to produce a multi-pattern entity embedding. We
fully evaluate the quality of entity profiles generated from real KGs. The
results show that our approach facilitates human understanding of entities in

  Transport of Two Species","  We present a rigorous mathematical approach of two species channel transport
within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, which explains the impact of
interparticle in-channel interactions. Different from mean field approaches,
the model explicitly conserves spatial correlations by considering stochastic
transitions between the channel's occupation states. The interparticle
interactions determine the Brownian ratchet like rectifying forces, which these
species exert mutually on each other. Perfect coupling of transport emerges by
an attractive empty channel and strong repulsive forces between particles of
the same species. Stochastic transitions are then confined to a subspace with
circular topology, which makes channel flows of both species become equivalent.
For opposing concentration gradients, this makes the species with the stronger
gradient the driving, positive entropy producing one, the other is driven and
produces negative entropy. A differential interaction with less repulsive
forces within particles of one species, but maintenance of this interaction for
the other species, adds a bypass path to this circular subspace. On this path a
leak flow of the species with less repulsive interparticle interaction emerges,
which is directed parallel to its concentration gradient, and, hence, produces
positive entropy. Now, appropriate strong opposing concentration gradients may
simultaneously parallelize flow of their respective species, which makes each
species produce positive entropy. The rectifying potential of the species with
the bypass option is diminished, which implies the existence of a gradient of
the other species, above which its flow and gradient are always parallel.
Conversely flow of the less coupled species may always be turned anti-parallel
to its gradient by a sufficient strong opposing gradient of the other one.

  using a personalized data generation strategy: Proof of concept by phantom
  study","  Objective: For real-time markerless tumour tracking in stereotactic lung
radiotherapy, we propose a different approach which uses patient-specific deep
learning (DL) using a personalized data generation strategy, avoiding the need
for collection of a large patient data set. We validated our strategy with
digital phantom simulation and epoxy phantom studies.
  Methods: We developed lung tumour tracking for radiotherapy using a
convolutional neural network trained for each phantom's lesion by using
multiple digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from each
phantom's treatment planning 4D-CT. We trained tumour-bone differentiation
using large numbers of training DRRs generated with various projection
geometries to simulate tumour motion. We solved the problem of using DRRs for
training and X-ray images for tracking by using the training DRRs with random
contrast transformation and random noise addition.
  Results: We defined adequate tracking accuracy as the % frames satisfying < 1
mm tracking error of the isocentre. In the simulation study, we achieved 100%
tracking accuracy in 3-cm spherical and 1.5 x 2.25 x 3-cm ovoid masses. In the
phantom study, we achieved 100% and 94.7% tracking accuracy in 3- and 2-cm
spherical masses, respectively. This required 32.5 ms/frame (30.8 fps)
real-time processing.
  Conclusions: We proved the potential feasibility of a real-time markerless
tumour tracking framework for stereotactic lung radiotherapy based on
patient-specific DL with personalized data generation with digital phantom and
epoxy phantom studies.
  Advances in Knowledge: Using DL with personalized data generation is an
efficient strategy for real-time lung tumour tracking.

2003.00309v1,2020-02-29,2020-02-29,Possible Lattice and Charge Order in CuxBi2Te2Se,"  Metal intercalation into layered topological insulator materials such as the
binary chalcogenide Bi2X3 (X=Te or Se) has yielded novel two-dimensional
electron-gas physics, phase transitions to superconductivity, as well as
interesting magnetic ground states. Of recent interest is the
intercalation-driven interplay between lattice distortions, density wave
ordering, and the emergence of new phenomena in the vicinity of instabilities
induced by intercalation. Here, we examine the effects of Cu-intercalation on
the ternary chalcogenide Bi2Te2Se. We report the discovery, in Cu0.3Bi2Te2Se,
of a periodic lattice distortion at room temperature, together with a charge
density wave transition around Td = 220K. We also report, for the first time, a
complete study of the CuxBi2Te2Se system, and the effect of Cu-intercalation on
crystal structure, phonon structure, and electronic properties for 0.0 $\le$ x
$\le$ 0.5. Our electron diffraction studies reveal strong Bragg spots at
reciprocal lattice positions forbidden by ABC stacking, possibly resulting from
stacking faults, or a superlattice. The c-axis lattice parameter varies
monotonically with x for 0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2, but drops precipitously for
higher x. Similarly, Raman phonon modes $A^2_{1g}$ and $E_g$ soften
monotonically for 0 $\lt$ x $\lt$ 0.2 but harden sharply for x $\gt$ 0.2. This
indicates that Cu likely intercalates up to x $\sim$0.2, followed by partial
site-substitutions at higher values. The resulting strain makes the 0.2 $\lt$ x
$\lt$ 0.3 region susceptible to instabilities and distortions. Our results
point toward the presence of an incommensurate CDW above Td = 220 K. This work
strengthens prevalent thought that intercalation contributes significantly to
instabilities in the lattice and charge degrees of freedom in layered
chalcogenides.

  autonomous vehicle design and regulation","  Walter Huang, a 38-year-old Apple Inc. engineer, died on March 23, 2018,
after his Tesla Model X crashed into a highway barrier in Mountain View,
California. Tesla immediately disavowed responsibility for the accident. ""The
fundamental premise of both moral and legal liability is a broken promise, and
there was none here: [Mr. Huang] was well aware that the Autopilot was not
perfect [and the] only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang
was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple
warnings to do so."" This is the standard response from Tesla and Uber, the
manufacturers of the automated vehicles involved in the six fatal accidents to
date: the automated vehicle isn't perfect, the driver knew it wasn't perfect,
and if only the driver had been paying attention and heeded the vehicle's
warnings, the accident would never have occurred.
  However, as researchers focused on human-automation interaction in aviation
and military operations, we cannot help but wonder if there really are no
broken promises and no legal liabilities. Science has a critical role in
determining legal liability, and courts appropriately rely on scientists and
engineers to determine whether an accident, or harm, was foreseeable.
Specifically, a designer could be found liable if, at the time of the accident,
scientists knew there was a systematic relationship between the accident and
the designer's untaken precaution.
  Nearly 70 years of research provides an undeniable answer: It is
insufficient, inappropriate, and dangerous to automate everything you can and
leave the rest to the human. There is a systematic relationship between the
design of automated vehicles and the types of accidents that are occurring now
and will inevitably continue to occur in the future. These accidents were not

it can significantly improve the overall user experience for consuming and

  The precise mathematical definition of Finsler spacetime is discussed by
using the {\em space of observers}. Special care is taken in some issues such
as: the fact that a Lorentz-Finsler metric would be physically measurable only
on the causal directions for a cone structure, the implications for models of

(LQBH) solution, starting from the spherical symmetric LQBH by applying the
Newman-Janis algorithm modified by Azreg-A\""{i}nou's non-complexification
procedure, and study the effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on its shadow.
Given the rotating LQBH, we discuss its horizon, ergosurface, and regularity as
$r \to 0$. Depending on the values of the specific angular momentum $a$ and the
polymeric function $P$ arising from LQG, we find that the rotating solution we
obtained can represent a regular black hole, a regular extreme black hole, or a
regular spacetime without horizon (a non-black-hole solution). We also study
the effects of LQG and rotation and show that, in addition to the specific
angular momentum, the polymeric function also causes deformations in the size
and shape of the black hole shadow. Interestingly, for a given value of $a$ and
inclination angle $\theta_0$, the apparent size of the shadow monotonically
decreases, and the shadow gets more distorted with increasing $P$. We also
consider the effects of $P$ on the deviations from the circularity of the
shadow and find that the deviation from circularity increases with increasing
$P$ for fixed values of $a$ and $\theta_0$. Additionally, we explore the
observational implications of $P$ in comparing with the latest Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) observation of the supermassive black hole, M87*. The
connection between the shadow radius and quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit
as well as the deflection of massive particles are also considered.

together more than 1100 researchers to discuss the latest advances in
photonics. Or rather, it didn't, because the meeting was completely delocalized
with the speakers, organizers, and attendees scattered across six continents
and hundreds of locations, connected via a video-conferencing tool and social
media. Despite this ""delocalisation,"" the meeting retained many characteristics
of a traditional conference: invited and contributed talks with follow-up
questions and discussion, and a poster session. However, unlike with
traditional conferences, all attendees avoided air travel, high registration
costs (it was completely free), CO2 emission, or visa issues. Surely the impact
on families was minimized as well, though participants in inconvenient time
zones had to wake up early or stay up late. In this Comment, we highlight the
key steps that enabled this event, offering tips and advice, to aid the
organisation of similar Online Meetups.

confirms the ability of the proposed network to preserve head pose of the input
image, mask the input identity, and synthesize a good-quality realistic face
image of a desired identity. We also show that our network can be used to
perform pose-preserving identity morphing and identity-preserving pose
morphing. The proposed method improves over a recent state-of-the-art method in

  Overloaded Hearts -- Linking Microstructure to Organ Phenotype","  Cardiac growth and remodeling (G&R) refers to structural changes in
myocardial tissue in response to chronic alterations in loading conditions. One
such condition is pressure overload where elevated wall stresses stimulate the
growth in cardiomyocyte thickness, associated with a phenotype of concentric
hypertrophy at the organ scale, and promote fibrosis. The initial hypertrophic
response can be considered adaptive and beneficial by favoring myocyte
survival, but over time if pressure overload conditions persist, maladaptive
mechanisms favoring cell death and fibrosis start to dominate, ultimately
mediating the transition towards an overt heart failure phenotype. The
underlying mechanisms linking biological factors at the myocyte level to
biomechanical factors at the systemic and organ level remain poorly understood.
Computational models of G&R show high promise as a unique framework for
providing a quantitative link between myocardial stresses and strains at the
organ scale to biological regulatory processes at the cellular level which
govern the hypertrophic response. However, microstructurally motivated,
rigorously validated computational models of G&R are still in their infancy.
This article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of
computational models to study cardiac G&R. The microstructure and
mechanosensing/mechanotransduction within cells of the myocardium is discussed
and quantitative data from previous experimental and clinical studies is
summarized. We conclude with a discussion of major challenges and possible
directions of future research that can advance the current state of cardiac G&R

been less embraced and it was only within the last century that a program of
applications for physics started. Regarding quantum physics, it has been only
in the previous decade or so that the corresponding literature resulted in a
set of defying papers. In such a context, this manuscript constitutes a cordial
invitation, whose purpose is simply to suggest, mostly through a heuristic and
unpretentious presentation, the extension of fractional quantum mechanics to
cosmological settings. Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical
summary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief
appraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details
(namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing.
Subsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is
introduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional
calculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn
(to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that
may affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of
minisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example
of investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we
restrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements,
we may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard
cosmology. In summary, the subject of fractional quantum cosmology is herewith
proposed, merely realized in terms of an open program constituted by several
challenges.

all finite structures is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). Note that for

computed entirely within FPT time. We investigate the free-connex variant of
submodular width and generalise Marx's result to non-Boolean queries as
follows: For every class $\Phi$ of CQs of bounded free-connex submodular width,
within FPT-preprocessing time we can build a data structure that allows to
enumerate, without repetition and with constant delay, all tuples of the query
result. Our proof builds upon Marx's splitting routine to decompose the query
result into a union of results; but we have to tackle the additional technical
difficulty to ensure that these can be enumerated efficiently.

not only important for gaining insight into fundamental network problems such
as network centrality measure, spectral partitioning, development of
approximation algorithms, but also is crucial for understanding many real-world
phenomena such as disease spreading, criticality in brain network dynamics. For
a network, an eigenvector is said to be localized when most of its components
take value near to zero, with a few components taking very high values. In this
article, we devise a methodology to construct a principal eigenvector (PEV)
localized network from a given input network. The methodology relies on adding
a small component having a wheel graph to the given input network. By extensive
numerical simulation and an analytical formulation based on the largest
eigenvalue of the input network, we compute the size of the wheel graph
required to localize the PEV of the combined network. Using the
susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we demonstrate the success of this
method for various models and real-world networks consider as input networks.
We show that on such PEV localized networks, the disease gets localized within
a small region of the network structure before the outbreaks. The study is
relevant in controlling spreading processes on complex systems represented by
networks.

dialogue systems. SLU parses natural language user utterances into semantic
frames. Previous work has shown that incorporating context information
significantly improves SLU performance for multi-turn dialogues. However,
collecting a large-scale human-labeled multi-turn dialogue corpus for the
target domains is complex and costly. To reduce dependency on the collection
and annotation effort, we propose a Context Encoding Language Transformer
(CELT) model facilitating exploiting various context information for SLU. We
explore different transfer learning approaches to reduce dependency on data
collection and annotation. In addition to unsupervised pre-training using
large-scale general purpose unlabeled corpora, such as Wikipedia, we explore
unsupervised and supervised adaptive training approaches for transfer learning
to benefit from other in-domain and out-of-domain dialogue corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model with the proposed
transfer learning approaches achieves significant improvement on the SLU

  metastable GeSn","  Controlling the growth kinetics from the vapor phase has been a powerful
paradigm enabling a variety of metastable epitaxial semiconductors such as
Sn-containing group IV semiconductors (Si)GeSn. In addition to its importance
for emerging photonic and optoelectronic applications, this class of materials
is also a rich platform to highlight the interplay between kinetics and
thermodynamic driving forces during growth of strained, nonequilibrium alloys.
Indeed, these alloys are inherently strained and supersaturated in Sn and thus
can suffer instabilities that are still to be fully elucidated. In this vein,
in this work the atomic-scale microstructure of Ge0.82Sn0.18 is investigated at
the onset of phase separation as the epitaxial growth aborts. In addition to
the expected accumulation of Sn on the surface leading to Sn-rich droplets and
sub-surface regions with the anticipated equilibrium Sn composition of 1.0at.%,
the diffusion of Sn atoms also yields conspicuous Sn-decorated filaments with
nonuniform Sn content in the range of ~1 to 11at.% . The latter are attributed
to the formation and propagation of dislocations, facilitating the Sn transport
toward the surface through pipe diffusion. Furthermore, the interface between
the Sn droplet and GeSn shows a distinct, defective layer with Sn content of
~22at.%. This layer is likely formed by the expelled excess equilibrium Ge as
the Sn solidifies, and its content seems to be a consequence of strain
minimization between tetragonal Sn-rich and cubic Ge-rich equilibrium phases.
The elucidation of these phenomena is crucial to understand the stability of
GeSn semiconductors and control their epitaxial growth at a uniform
composition.

Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC7) aims to push the state of the art
of utterance classification for real world goal-oriented dialog systems, for
which participants need to select the correct next utterances from a set of
candidates for the multi-turn context. This paper presents our systems that are
ranked top 1 on both datasets under this challenge, one focused and small
(Advising) and the other more diverse and large (Ubuntu). Previous
state-of-the-art models use hierarchy-based (utterance-level and token-level)
neural networks to explicitly model the interactions among different turns'
utterances for context modeling. In this paper, we investigate a sequential
matching model based only on chain sequence for multi-turn response selection.
Our results demonstrate that the potentials of sequential matching approaches
have not yet been fully exploited in the past for multi-turn response
selection. In addition to ranking top 1 in the challenge, the proposed model
outperforms all previous models, including state-of-the-art hierarchy-based
models, on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection benchmark

robin arbiter has been proposed to work with packet switching system to have
increased speed in providing access and scheduling. Round robin arbiter is a
doorway to a particular bus based on request along with equal priority and
gives turns to devices connected to it in a cyclic order. Considering the rapid
growth in computer networking and the emergence of computer automation which
will need much more access to the existing limited resources, this paper
emphasizes on designing a reconfigurable round robin arbiter over FPGA which
takes parallel requests and processes them with high efficiency and less delay
than existing designs. Proposed round robin arbiter encounters with 4 to 12
devices. Results show that with 200% increment in the number of connected
devices, only 2.69% increment has been found in the delay. With less delay,
proposed round robin arbiter exhibits high speed performance with higher
traffic, which is a new feature in comparison with the existing designs.

two-component Bose- Einstein condensates (BECs), under the action of gravity,
by tweezers induced by spatially confined spin-orbit (SO) coupling applied to
the BEC, with the help of focused laser illumination. Solitons of two types are
considered, semi-dipoles and mixed modes. We find critical values of the
gravity force, up to which the solitons may be held or transferred by the
tweezers. The dependence of the critical force on the magnitude and spatial
extension of the localized SO interaction, as well as on the solitons norm and
speed (in the transfer regime), are systematically studied by means of
numerical methods, and analytically with the help of a quasi-particle
approximation for the soliton. In particular, a noteworthy finding is that the
critical gravity force increases with the increase of the transfer speed (i.e.,
moving solitons are more robust than quiescent ones). Nonstationary regimes are
addressed too, by considering abrupt application of gravity to solitons created
in the weightless setting. In that case, solitons feature damped shuttle
motion, provided that the gravity force does not exceed a dynamical critical
value, which is smaller than its static counterpart. The results may help to
design gravimeters based on ultracold atoms.

observed that many state-of-the-art forensic algorithms are sensitive to image

handle this issue, we propose a novel pooling strategy called ITERATIVE
POOLING. This pooling strategy can dynamically adjust input tensors in a
discrete without much loss of information as in ROI Max-pooling. This pooling
strategy can be used with any of the existing deep models and for demonstration
purposes, we show its utility on Resnet-18 for the case of resampling detection

novel functionalities, in particular if different functionalities are merged in
hybrid nanomaterials. Hybrid carbon-based hierarchical nanostructures are
particularly promising for electrochemical energy storage since they combine
benefits of nanosize effects, enhanced electrical conductivity and integrity of
bulk materials. We show that endohedral multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNT)
encapsulating high-capacity (here: conversion and alloying) electrode materials
have a high potential for use in anode materials for lithium-ion batteries
(LIB). There are two essential characteristics of filled CNT relevant for
application in electrochemical energy storage: (1) rigid hollow cavities of the
CNT provide upper limits for nanoparticles in their inner cavities which are
both separated from the fillings of other CNT and protected against
degradation. In particular, the CNT shells resist strong volume changes of
encapsulates in response to electrochemical cycling, which in conventional
conversion and alloying materials hinders application in energy storage
devices. (2) Carbon mantles ensure electrical contact to the active material as
they are unaffected by potential cracks of the encapsulate and form a stable
conductive network in the electrode compound. Our studies confirm that
encapsulates are electrochemically active and can achieve full theoretical
reversible capacity. The results imply that encapsulating nanostructures inside
CNT can provide a route to new high-performance nanocomposite anode materials
for LIB.

This contrasts with the biological brain which purpose is to control a body in

neuroscience and robotics closer together by integrating open-source software
components from these two fields. The resulting framework allows to evaluate
the validity of biologically-plausibe plasticity models in closed-loop robotics
environments. We demonstrate this framework to evaluate Synaptic Plasticity
with Online REinforcement learning (SPORE), a reward-learning rule based on
synaptic sampling, on two visuomotor tasks: reaching and lane following. We
show that SPORE is capable of learning to perform policies within the course of
simulated hours for both tasks. Provisional parameter explorations indicate
that the learning rate and the temperature driving the stochastic processes
that govern synaptic learning dynamics need to be regulated for performance
improvements to be retained. We conclude by discussing the recent deep
reinforcement learning techniques which would be beneficial to increase the
functionality of SPORE on visuomotor tasks.

2003.01476v1,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,NGC 3894: a young radio galaxy seen by Fermi-LAT,"  Context. According to radiative models, radio galaxies may produce gamma-ray
emission from the first stages of their evolution. However, very few such
galaxies have been detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) so far.
  Aims. NGC 3894 is a nearby (z = 0.0108) object that belongs to the class of
compact symmetric objects (CSOs, i.e., the most compact and youngest radio
galaxies), which is associated with a gamma-ray counterpart in the Fourth
Fermi-LAT source catalog. Here we present a study of the source in the
gamma-ray and radio bands aimed at investigating its high-energy emission and
assess its young nature.
  Methods. We analyzed 10.8 years of Fermi-LAT data between 100 MeV and 300 GeV
and determined the spectral and variability characteristics of the source.
Multi-epoch very long baseline array (VLBA) observations between 5 and 15 GHz
over a period of 35 years were used to study the radio morphology of NGC 3894
and its evolution.
  Results. NGC 3894 is detected in gamma-rays with a significance >9 sigma over
the full period, and no significant variability has been observed in the
gamma-ray flux on a yearly time-scale. The spectrum is modeled with a flat
power law ($\Gamma$ = 2.0$\pm$0.1) and a flux on the order of 2.2 $\times$
10$^{-9}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. For the first time, the VLBA data allow us to
constrain with high precision the apparent velocity of the jet and counter-jet
side to be $\beta_{\mathrm{app,NW}}$ = 0.132$\pm$0.004 and
$\beta_{\mathrm{app,SE}}$ = 0.065$\pm$0.003, respectively.
  Conclusions. Fermi-LAT and VLBA results favor the youth scenario for the
inner structure of this object, with an estimated dynamical age of 59$\pm$5
years. The estimated range of viewing angle (10{\deg} < $\theta$ < 21{\deg})
does not exclude a possible jet-like origin of the gamma-ray emission.

200, 20, and 7.7 GeV. The results for $\mathrm{^{197}Au+^{197}Au}$ collisions
are comparable with those of previous experimental STAR data. The transverse
momentum $p_{T}$ spectra of charged particles ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and
$\bar{p}$) at the kinetic freeze-out stage, based on a blast-wave model, are
also discussed. In addition, we use a statistical thermal model to extract the
parameters at the chemical freeze-out stage, which agree with those from other
thermal model calculations. It was found that there is a competitive
relationship between the kinetic freeze-out parameter $T_{kin}$ and the radial
expansion velocity $\beta_{T}$, which also agrees with the STAR or ALICE
results. We found that the chemical freeze-out strangeness potential $\mu_{s}$
remains constant in all collision systems and that the fireball radius $R$ is
dominated by $\left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle$, which can be well
fitted by a function of $a \left\langle \mathrm{N_{Part}}\right\rangle^{b}$

nonpotential components, magnetic energy and relative helicity can both also be
decomposed into two quantities: potential and free energies, and
volume-threading and current-carrying helicities. In this study, we perform a
coupled analysis of their behaviors in a set of parametric 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of solar-like eruptions. We present the
general formulations for the time-varying components of energy and helicity in
resistive MHD. We calculated them numerically with a specific gauge, and
compared their behaviors in the numerical simulations, which differ from one
another by their imposed boundary-driving motions. Thus, we investigated the
impact of different active regions surface flows on the development of the
energy and helicity-related quantities. Despite general similarities in their
overall behaviors, helicities and energies display different evolutions that
cannot be explained in a unique framework. While the energy fluxes are similar
in all simulations, the physical mechanisms that govern the evolution of the
helicities are markedly distinct from one simulation to another: the evolution
of volume-threading helicity can be governed by boundary fluxes or helicity
transfer, depending on the simulation. The eruption takes place for the same
value of the ratio of the current-carrying helicity to the total helicity in
all simulations. However, our study highlights that this threshold can be
reached in different ways, with different helicity-related processes dominating
for different photospheric flows. This means that the details of the
pre-eruptive dynamics do not influence the eruption-onset helicity-related
threshold. Nevertheless, the helicity-flux dynamics may be more or less
efficient in changing the time required to reach the onset of the eruption.

semi-secular perturbations operating only on ultra-wide (~0.1-0.4 Hill-radius)
KBO-binaries can robustly lead to gentle, slow-speed binary mergers at
arbitrarily high obliquities, but low rotational velocities, that can reproduce
MU69's (and similar oblique contact binaries) characteristics. Using N-body
simulations, we find that ~15% of all ultra-wide binaries with cosine-uniform
inclination distribution are likely to merge through this process. Moreover, we
find that such mergers are sufficiently gentle as to only slightly deform the
KBO shape, and can produce the measured rotation speed of MU69. The
semi-secular contact-binary formation channel not only explains the observed
properties of MU69, but could also apply for other Kuiper/asteroid belt
binaries, and for Solar/extra-solar moon systems.

distribution of the steady accretion discs seen in nova-like variables, Nixon &
Pringle (2019) proposed that the accretion energy is redistributed outwards by
means of strong, magnetically driven, surface flows. In this paper we note that
the ""powerful, rotating disc winds"" observed in the soft states of black hole
X-ray binaries, and also in the disc around a magnetized neutron star in Her
X-1, have the properties of the outflows postulated by Nixon & Pringle to exist
in the nova-like variable accretion discs around white dwarfs. The relevant
properties are that the flows are not winds, but are, instead, bound flows
(traveling at less than the escape velocity) and that the mass fluxes in the
flows are a substantial fraction of the accretion rate in the disc.

2003.01823v2,2020-03-03,2020-03-03,A New Approach to Solar Flare Prediction,"  All three components of the current density are required to compute the
heating rate due to free magnetic energy dissipation. Here we present a first
test of a new model developed to determine if the times of increases in the
resistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated with
the subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3 D,
non-force-free magnetohydrodynamic model restricted to the near-photospheric
region is used to compute time series of the complete current density and the
resistive heating rate per unit volume $(Q(t))$ in each pixel in neutral line
regions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic
field ${\bf B}$ measured by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Spurious Doppler periods due to SDO
orbital motion are filtered out of the time series for ${\bf B}$ in every AR
pixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of
the NLR area integral $Q_i(t)$ of $Q(t)$ is found to be a scale invariant power
law distribution essentially identical to the observed CDF for the total energy
released in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares and the
photospheric $Q_i$ are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model
predicts spikes in $Q_i$ with values orders of magnitude above background
values. These spikes are driven by spikes in the non-force free component of
the current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated with
times of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes
occur on granulation scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal
current sheets. It is also found that the times of relatively large values of
the rate of change of the NLR unsigned magnetic flux are also plausibly
correlated with the times of subsequent M and X flares, and spikes in $Q_i$.

the basal facet of the TIP4P/2005 model is smooth, the prismatic facet is close

2003.01845v1,2020-03-04,2020-03-04,Molecule formation in dust-poor irradiated jets I. Stationary disk winds,"  Recent ALMA observations suggest that the highest velocity part of molecular
protostellar jets are launched from the dust-sublimation regions of the
accretion disks (<0.3 au). However, formation and survival of molecules in
inner protostellar disk winds, in the presence of a harsh FUV radiation field
and the absence of dust, remain unexplored. We aim at determining if simple
molecules can be synthesized and spared in fast and collimated dust-free disk
winds or if a fraction of dust is necessary to explain the observed molecular
abundances. This work is based on the Paris-Durham shock code designed to model
irradiated environments. Fundamental properties of the dust-free chemistry are
investigated from single point models. A laminar 1D disk wind model is then
built using a parametric flow geometry. This model includes time-dependent
chemistry and the attenuation of the radiation field by gas-phase
photoprocesses. We show that a small fraction of H2 (< 1e-2), primarily formed
through the H- route, can efficiently initiate molecule synthesis such as CO
and SiO above TK ~ 800 K. The attenuation of the radiation field by atomic
species (eg. C, Si, S) proceeds through continuum self-shielding. This process
ensures efficient formation of CO, OH, SiO, H2O through neutral-neutral
reactions, and the survival of these molecules. Class 0 dust-free winds with
high mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}_w >$ 2e-6 Msun/yr) are predicted to be rich in
molecules if warm (TK > 800 K). The molecular content of disk winds is very
sensitive to the presence of dust and a mass-fraction of surviving dust as
small as 1e-5 significantly increases the H2O and SiO abundances. Chemistry of
high-velocity jets is a powerful tool to probe their content in dust and
uncover their launching point. Models of internal shocks are required to fully
exploit the current (sub-)millimeter observations and prepare future JWST
observations.

  Neural Networks","  The quantized neural networks (QNNs) can be useful for neural network
acceleration and compression, but during the training process they pose a
challenge: how to propagate the gradient of loss function through the graph
flow with a derivative of 0 almost everywhere. In response to this
non-differentiable situation, we propose a novel Asymptotic-Quantized Estimator
(AQE) to estimate the gradient. In particular, during back-propagation, the
graph that relates inputs to output remains smoothness and differentiability.
At the end of training, the weights and activations have been quantized to
low-precision because of the asymptotic behaviour of AQE. Meanwhile, we propose
a M-bit Inputs and N-bit Weights Network (MINW-Net) trained by AQE, a quantized
neural network with 1-3 bits weights and activations. In the inference phase,
we can use XNOR or SHIFT operations instead of convolution operations to
accelerate the MINW-Net. Our experiments on CIFAR datasets demonstrate that our
AQE is well defined, and the QNNs with AQE perform better than that with
Straight-Through Estimator (STE). For example, in the case of the same ConvNet
that has 1-bit weights and activations, our MINW-Net with AQE can achieve a
prediction accuracy 1.5\% higher than the Binarized Neural Network (BNN) with
STE. The MINW-Net, which is trained from scratch by AQE, can achieve comparable
classification accuracy as 32-bit counterparts on CIFAR test sets. Extensive
experimental results on ImageNet dataset show great superiority of the proposed
AQE and our MINW-Net achieves comparable results with other state-of-the-art
QNNs.

Results for three 2D isotropic lattice topologies (triangular, hexagonal and

a brittle manner. We show that the difference in such failure behavior can be
explained by the size of the plastic zone that grows upon crack propagation,
and conclude that the nature of crack propagation in lattices (brittle vs
ductile) depends both on the constituent material and the lattice architecture.
While results are presented for 2D truss-lattices, the proposed approach can be

notion of closure-phase invented in the context of interferometry, but that
applies to well corrected diffraction dominated images produced by an arbitrary

formation of observable quantities robust against residual aberrations. In
practice, detection limits reported thus far seem to be dominated by systematic
errors induced by calibration biases not sufficiently filtered out by the
kernel projection operator. This paper focuses on the impact the initial
modeling of the aperture has on these errors and introduces a strategy to
mitigate them, using a more accurate aperture transmission model. The paper
first uses idealized monochromatic simulations of a non trivial aperture to
illustrate the impact modeling choices have on calibration errors. It then
applies the outlined prescription to two distinct data-sets of images whose
analysis has previously been published. The use of a transmission model to
describe the aperture results in a significant improvement over the previous
type of analysis. The thus reprocessed data-sets generally lead to more
accurate results, less affected by systematic errors. As kernel-phase observing
programs are becoming more ambitious, accuracy in the aperture description is
becoming paramount to avoid situations where contrast detection limits are
dominated by systematic errors. Prescriptions outlined in this paper will
benefit any attempt at exploiting kernel-phase for high-contrast detection.

2003.02094v1,2020-03-04,2020-03-04,Stellar wind models of central stars of planetary nebulae,"  Fast line-driven stellar winds play an important role in the evolution of
planetary nebulae. We provide global hot star wind models of central stars of
planetary nebulae. The models predict wind structure including the mass-loss
rates, terminal velocities, and emergent fluxes from basic stellar parameters.
We applied our wind code for parameters corresponding to evolutionary stages
between the asymptotic giant branch and white dwarf phases. We study the
influence of metallicity and wind inhomogeneities (clumping) on the wind
properties. Line-driven winds appear very early after the star leaves the
asymptotic giant branch (at the latest for $T_\rm{eff}\approx10\,$kK) and fade
away at the white dwarf cooling track (below $T_\rm{eff}=105\,$kK). Their
mass-loss rate mostly scales with the stellar luminosity and, consequently, the
mass-loss rate only varies slightly during the transition from the red to the
blue part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. There are the following two
exceptions to the monotonic behavior: a bistability jump at around $20\,$kK,
where the mass-loss rate decreases by a factor of a few (during evolution) due
to a change in iron ionization, and an additional maximum at about
$T_\rm{eff}=40-50\,$kK. On the other hand, the terminal velocity increases from
about a few hundreds of $\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ to a few thousands of
$\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$ during the transition as a result of stellar radius
decrease. The wind terminal velocity also significantly increases at the
bistability jump. Derived wind parameters reasonably agree with observations.
The effect of clumping is stronger at the hot side of the bistability jump than
at the cool side. Derived fits to wind parameters can be used in evolutionary
models and in studies of planetary nebula formation. A predicted bistability
jump in mass-loss rates can cause the appearance of an additional shell of
planetary nebula.

Erlangen Program: the background space has a symmetry group, and the basic
operators should commute according to the Lie algebra of that group. We argue
that the definition should be the opposite: background space has a direct
physical meaning only on classical level while on quantum level symmetry should
be defined by a Lie algebra of basic operators. Then the fact that de Sitter
symmetry is more general than Poincare one can be proved mathematically. The
problem of explaining cosmological acceleration is very difficult but, as
follows from our results, there exists a scenario that the phenomenon of
cosmological acceleration can be explained proceeding from basic principles of
quantum theory. The explanation has nothing to do with existence or
nonexistence of dark energy and therefore the cosmological constant problem and
the dark energy problem do not arise. We consider finite quantum theory (FQT)
where states are elements of a space over a finite ring or field with
characteristic $p$ and operators of physical quantities act in this space. We
prove that, with the same approach to symmetry, FQT and finite mathematics are
more general than standard quantum theory and classical mathematics,
respectively: the latter theories are special degenerated cases of the former

on shorter time-scales. Super-sonic downflows are variable within this sunspot
both in terms of spatial structuring and velocities. 13 of the 16 raster scans

was found in 14 of these rasters, with the spatial structuring differing from
that inferred from the Si IV 1394 {\AA} line. In the sit-and-stare data, no

2003.02492v1,2020-03-05,2020-03-05,Level statistics of extended states in random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,"  Absence of level repulsion between extended states in random non-Hermitian
systems is demonstrated. As a result, the general Wigner-Dyson distributions of
level spacing of diffusive metals in the usual Hermitian systems is replaced by
the Poisson distribution for quasiparticle level spacing of non-Hermitian
disordered metals in the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. This is a
very surprising result because Poisson statistics is universally true for the
Anderson insulators where energy eigenstates do not overlap with each other so
that energy levels are independent from each other.For disordered metals where
different eigenstates overlap with each other, one should expect different
levels trying to stay away from each other so that the Poisson distribution
should not apply there. Our results show that the larger non-Hermitian energy
(dissipation) can invalidate level repulsion principle that holds dearly in
quantum mechanics. Thus, our theory provides a unified picture for recent
discovery of so called ""level attraction"" in various systems. It provides also
a theoretical basis for manipulating energy levels.

gravity sourced by a conformally coupled scalar field under the first-order
approximation when the perturbation matter fields satisfy the null energy
condition. First of all, we show that the Wald entropy of this theory does not
obey the linearized second law for the scalar-hairy Lovelock gravity which
contains the higher curvature terms even if we replace the gravitational part
of Wald entropy with Jacobson-Myers (JM) entropy. This implies that we cannot
naively add the scalar field term of the Wald entropy to the JM entropy of the
purely Lovelock gravity to get a valid linearized second law. By rescaling the
metric, the action of the scalar field can be written as a purely Lovelock
action with another metric. Using this property, by analogy with the JM entropy
of the purely Lovelock gravity, we introduce a new formula of the entropy in
the scalar-hairy Lovelock gravity. Then, we show that this new JM entropy
increases along the event horizon for Vaidya-like black hole solutions and
therefore it obeys a linearized second law. Moreover, we show that different
from the entropy in $F($Riemann$)$ gravity, the difference between the JM
entropy and Wald entropy also contains some additional corrections from the
scalar field.

  cavitation in overstretched Lennard Jones fluids","  Simulations are widely used to study nucleation in first order phase
transitions due to the fact that they have access to the relevant length and
time scales. However, simulations face the problem that nucleation is an
activated process. Therefore, rare event simulation techniques are needed to
promote the formation of the critical nucleus. The Seeding method, where the
simulations are started with the nucleus already formed, has proven quite
useful in efficiently providing estimates of the nucleation rate for a wide
range of orders of magnitude. So far, Seeding has been employed in the NPT
ensemble, where the nucleus either grows or redissolves. Thus, several
trajectories have to be run in order to find the thermodynamic conditions that
make the seeded nucleus critical. Moreover, the nucleus lifetime is short and
the statistics for obtaining its properties is consequently poor. To deal with
these shortcomings we extend the Seeding method to the NVT ensemble. We focus
on the problem of bubble nucleation in a mestastable Lennard Jones fluid. We
show that, in the NVT ensemble, it is possible to equilibrate and stabilise
critical bubbles for a long time. The nucleation rate inferred from NVT-Seeding
is fully consistent with that coming from NPT-Seeding. The former is quite
suitable to obtain the nucleation rate along isotherms, whereas the latter is
preferable if the dependence of the rate with temperature at constant pressure
is required. Care should be taken with finite size effects when using
NVT-Seeding. Further work is required to extend NVT seeding to other sorts of
phase transitions.

capable of determining the magnitude of the magnetic field and its direction in
the core of fusion plasmas. The primary excitation channel for fast hydrogen
atoms in injected neutral beams, with energy in the range of 25-1000 keV, is
due to collisions with protons and impurity ions (e.g., He$^{2+}$ and heavier
impurities). As a result of such excitation, at the particle density of
10$^{13}$-10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$, the line intensities of the Stark multiplets do
not follow statistical expectations (i.e., the populations of fine-structure
levels within the same principal quantum number $n$ are not proportional to
their statistical weights). Hence, any realistic modeling of MSE spectra has to
include the relevant collisional atomic data. In this paper we provide a
general expression for the excitation cross sections in parabolic states within
$n$=3 for an arbitrary orientation between the direction of the motion-induced
electric field and the proton-atom collisional axis. The calculations make use
of the density matrix obtained with the atomic orbital close coupling method
and the method can be applied to other collisional systems (e.g., He$^{2+}$,
Be$^{4+}$, C$^{6+}$, etc.). The resulting cross sections are given as simple
fits that can be directly applied to spectral modeling. For illustration we
note that the asymmetry detected in the first classical cathode ray experiments
between the red- and blue-shifted spectral components can be quantitatively
studied using the proposed approach.

rates that are consistent with independent calculations not based on the

radius of the critical bubble give different rate values. The accuracy of each
criterion depends of the degree of superheating. Moreover, Seeding simulations
show that the surface tension depends on pressure for a given temperature.
Therefore, using Classical Nucleation Theory with the coexistence surface

The gravastar consists of three regions, viz., (I) Interior region, (II)

2003.02755v1,2020-03-05,2020-03-05,Homogeneous Ice Nucleation Rate in Water Droplets,"  To predict the radiative forcing of clouds it is necessary to know the rate
with which ice homogeneously nucleates in supercooled water. Such rate is often
measured in drops to avoid the presence of impurities. At large supercooling
small (nanoscopic) drops must be used to prevent simultaneous nucleation
events. The pressure inside such drops is larger than the atmospheric one by
virtue of the Laplace equation. In this work, we take into account such
pressure raise in order to predict the nucleation rate in droplets using the
TIP4P/Ice water model. We start from a recent estimate of the maximum drop size
that can be used at each supercooling avoiding simultaneous nucleation events
[Espinosa et al. J. Chem. Phys., 2016]. We then evaluate the pressure inside
the drops with the Laplace equation. Finally, we obtain the rate as a function
of the supercooling by interpolating our previous results for 1 and 2000 bar
[Espinosa et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2016] using the Classical Nucleation Theory
expression for the rate. This requires, in turn, interpolating the ice-water
interfacial free energy and chemical potential difference. The TIP4P/Ice rate
curve thus obtained is in good agreement with most droplet-based experiments.
In particular, we find a good agreement with measurements performed using
nanoscopic drops, that are currently under debate. The successful comparison
between model and experiments suggests that TIP4P/Ice is a reliable model to
study the water-to-ice transition and that Classical Nucleation Theory is a
good framework to understand it.

pressure curves, which closely follow expectations from a renormalized mean
field liquid state theory, show that there are no layering phase transitions in
the thermodynamic sense along the sublimation line. Instead, we find that
transitions at mean field level are rounded due to capillary wave fluctuations.
We see signatures that true first order layering transitions could arise at low

  Spectrometer Data Using Sparsity Prior","  The strong radiative forcing by atmospheric methane has stimulated interest
in identifying natural and anthropogenic sources of this potent greenhouse gas.
Point sources are important targets for quantification, and anthropogenic
targets have potential for emissions reduction. Methane point source plume
detection and concentration retrieval have been previously demonstrated using
data from the Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer Next Generation
(AVIRIS-NG). Current quantitative methods have tradeoffs between computational
requirements and retrieval accuracy, creating obstacles for processing
real-time data or large datasets from flight campaigns. We present a new
computationally efficient algorithm that applies sparsity and an albedo
correction to matched filter retrieval of trace gas concentration-pathlength.
The new algorithm was tested using AVIRIS-NG data acquired over several point
source plumes in Ahmedabad, India. The algorithm was validated using simulated
AVIRIS-NG data including synthetic plumes of known methane concentration.
Sparsity and albedo correction together reduced the root mean squared error of
retrieved methane concentration-pathlength enhancement by 60.7% compared with a
previous robust matched filter method. Background noise was reduced by a factor
of 2.64. The new algorithm was able to process the entire 300 flightline 2016

the consideration of the vector-channel contributions leads to lower value of
pion condensate in superfluid phase, compared with the standard Lagrangian of

number density, and the discrepancy is getting larger with the increase of
isospin potential. Compared with the recent results from Lattice QCD, the
isospin density and energy density we obtained with $\alpha=0.5$ agree with the
data of lattice well. In the phase diagram in the $T-\mu_I$ plane for
$\mu_B=0$, we can see that the difference of the critical temperatures of phase

results showed that while the decoherence effect is detrimental to QFI, effects
of such classical correlations on QFI are channel-dependent. For the Bell-type
probe states, the classical correlations on consecutive actions of the
depolarizing and phase flip channels can be harnessed to improve QFI, while the
classical correlations in the bit flip and bit-phase flip channels induce a
slight decrease of QFI. For a more general parameterization form of the probe
states, the advantage of using initial correlated system on improving QFI can
also be remained in a wide regime of the correlated quantum channels.

are walking in opposite directions. We demonstrate, using a molecular dynamics
approach applying the social force model, that a simple array of obstacles
improves flow rates by producing flow separations even in crowded situations.
We also report on a developed model describing the separation behavior that
regards an array of obstacles as a membrane and induces spontaneous separation
of pedestrians groups. When appropriately designed, those obstacles are fully
capable of controlling the filtering direction so that pedestrians tend to keep
moving to their left (or right) spontaneously. These results have the potential
to provide useful guidelines for industrial designs aimed at improving
ubiquitous human mobility.

degree of coherence has been established for classical and single-particle
quantum states [JOSA B {\bf 36}, 2765 (2019)]. Using the same mathematical
construction, in this article, we define the intrinsic degree of coherence of
two-qubit states and demonstrate its usefulness in quantifying two-particle
quantum correlations and entanglement. In this context, first of all, we show
that the intrinsic degree of coherence of a two-qubit state puts an upper bound
on the violations of Bell inequalities that can be achieved with the state and
that a two-qubit state with intrinsic degree of coherence less than
$1/\sqrt{3}$ cannot violate Bell inequalities. We then show that the quantum
discord of a two-qubit state, which quantifies the amount of quantum
correlations available in the two-qubit state for certain tasks, is bounded
from above by the intrinsic degree of coherence of the state. Next, in the
context of two-particle entanglement, we show that the range of values that the
concurrence of a two-qubit state can take is decided by the intrinsic degree of
coherence of the two-qubit state together with that of the individual qubits.
Finally, for the polarization two-qubit states generated by parametric
down-conversion of a pump photon, we propose an experimental scheme for
measuring the intrinsic degree of coherence of two-qubit states. We also
present our theoretical study showing how the intrinsic degree of coherence of
a pump photon dictates the maximum intrinsic degree of coherence of the

explanation for dwarf nova outbursts, it is still necessary to confront its
predictions to observations because much of the constraints on angular momentum
transport in accretion discs are derived from the application of this model to
real systems.
  Aims. We test the predictions of the model concerning the multicolour time
evolution of outbursts for two well--observed systems, SS Cyg and VW Hyi.
  Methods. We calculate the multicolour evolution of dwarf nova outbursts using
the disc instability model and taking into account the contribution from the
irradiated secondary, the white dwarf and the hot spot.
  Results. Observations definitely show the existence of a hysteresis in the
optical colour-magnitude diagram during the evolution of dwarf nova outbursts.
We find that the disc instability model naturally explains the existence and
the orientation of this hysteresis. For the specific cases of SS Cyg and VW
Hyi, the colour and magnitude ranges covered during the evolution of the system
are in reasonable agreement with observations. However, the observed colours
are bluer than observed near the peak of the outbursts -- as in steady systems,
and the amplitude of the hysteresis cycle is smaller than observed. The
predicted colours significantly depend on the assumptions made for calculating
the disc spectrum during rise, and on the magnitude of the secondary
irradiation for the decaying part of the outburst.
  Conclusions. Improvements of the spectral disc models are strongly needed if
one wishes to address the system evolution in the UV.

accumulate an adiabatic geometric phase (AGP) if the nonlinear coefficient of
the crystal is modulated in a proper manner along the nonlinear crystal. This
concept was studied so far only for the case in which the pump wave is much
stronger than the two other waves, hence can be assumed to be constant. Here we
extend this analysis for the fully nonlinear process, in which all three waves
can be depleted and we show that the sign and magnitude of the AGP can be
controlled by the period, phase and duty cycle of the nonlinear modulation
pattern. In this fully nonlinear interaction, all the states of the system can
be mapped onto a closed surface. Specifically, we study a process in which the
eigenstate of the system follows a circular rotation on the surface. Our
analysis reveals that the AGP equals to the difference between the total phase
accumulated along the circular trajectory and that along its vertical
projection, which is universal for the undepleted (linear) and depleted
(nonlinear) cases. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the AGPs in the
processes of sum-frequency generation and difference-frequency generation have
opposite chirality. Finally, we utilize the AGP in the fully nonlinear case for
splitting the beam into different diffraction orders in the far field.

G13 activation at a 10 {\mu}M concentration, indicating that these pepducins
may act as allosteric agonists of NTS1. Additionally, we used surface plasmon

the series in an acute pain model (tail-flick test) by measuring tail

complex plane consisting of all the roots of the characteristic equation when
the system matrices are subjected to all possible perturbations with a given
upper bound. The pseudospectral abscissa are defined as the maximum real part
of the characteristic roots in the pseudospectra and, therefore, they are for
instance important from a robust stability point of view. In this paper we
present a numerical method for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa
of retarded delay differential equations with discrete pointwise delays. Our
approach is based on the connections between the pseudospectra and the level
sets of an appropriately defined complex function. These connections lead us to
a bisection algorithm for the computation of the pseudospectral abscissa, where
each step relies on checking the presence of imaginary axis eigenvalues of an
appropriately defined operator. Because this operator is infinite-dimensional a
predictor-corrector approach is taken. In the predictor step the bisection
algorithm is applied where the operator is discretized into a matrix, yielding
approximations for the pseudospectral abscissa. The effect of the
discretization is fully characterized in the paper. In the corrector step, the
approximate pseudospectral abscissa are corrected to any given accuracy, by

colloid immersed in a solution of self-avoiding polymers is studied by
mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. A drastic enhancement of the rotational
diffusion by more than an order of magnitude in the presence of activity is
obtained. The amplification is a consequence of two effects, a decrease of the
amount of adsorbed polymers by active motion and an asymmetric encounter with
polymers on the squirmer surface, which yields an additional torque and random
noise for the rotational motion. Our simulations suggest a way to control the
rotational dynamics of squirmer-type microswimmers by the degree of polymer
adsorption and system heterogeneity.

  Polyatomic Stripe Lattices","  The quantum Hall effect is generally understood for free electron gases, in
which topologically protected edge states between Landau levels (LLs) form
conducting channels at the edge of the sample. In periodic crystals, the LLs
are imprinted with lattice properties; plateaus in the transverse Hall
conductivity are not equidistant in energy anymore. Herein, crystals with a
polyatomic basis are considered. For a stripe arrangement of different atoms,
the band structure resorts nontrivially and exhibits strong oscillations that
form a salient pattern with very small bandgaps. The Hall conductivity strongly
decreases for energies within these bands, and only sharp peaks remain for
energies in the gap. These effects are traced back to open orbits in the
initial band structure; the corresponding LLs are formed from states with
positive and negative effective mass. The partial cancellation of transverse
charge conductivity also holds for different polyatomic stripe lattices and
even when the magnetic field is replaced by a topologically nontrivial spin
texture. The topological Hall effect is suppressed in the presence of magnetic
skyrmions. The discussion is complemented by calculations of Hofstadter
butterflies and orbital magnetization.

Li(x)Ni(0.5)Mn(1.5)O(4) (LNMO) at smaller x values. We argue that multi-step
reactions, involving first formation of CEI films and then further oxidization
of CEI at higher potentials, are most relevant to capacity fade. Mechanisms
associated with dissolution or oxidation of native Li2CO3 films, which is

simulating the quantum dynamics of a material system, we design a
(parameterized) arbitrary single-qubit rotation instruction and a two-qubit
entangling controlled-Z instruction. We introduce dynamic gate set and paging
mechanisms to implement the instructions. To evaluate the functionality and
performance of these two instructions, we implement a two-qubit version of an

higher pressures, when the homogeneous broadening becomes comparable to the
typical Doppler shift per elastic collision, the velocity changing collisions
cease to contribute significantly to the incremental pressure broadening. A
time-dependent soft collision model is developed to illustrate the transition
between low and high pressure regimes of sub-Doppler pressure-broadening.

We aim to understand the composition of the gas in an exoplanet atmosphere
which is in equilibrium with a planetary crust. Methods. The molecular
composition of the gas above a surface made of a mixture of solid and liquid
materials is determined by assuming phase equilibrium for given pressure,
temperature and element abundances. We study total element abundances that
represent different parts of the Earth's crust (Continental Crust, Bulk
Silicate Earth, Mid Oceanic Ridge Basalt), CI chondrites and abundances
measured in polluted white dwarfs. For temperatures between 600K and 3500K, the
near-crust atmospheres of all considered total element abundances are mainly
composed of H2O, CO2, SO2 and in some cases of O2 and H2. For temperatures
500K, only N2-rich or CH4-rich atmospheres remain. For 3500K, the atmospheric
gas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO,
CaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of
phyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower
temperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700K and
inhibit the presence of liquid water. Measurements of the atmospheric
composition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet
crusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different
kinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers,
but do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between
crust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules
might be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical
equilibrium.

metric corresponding to the collapse of spherically symmetric matter with the
formation of a black hole. Two approaches are considered: in the first, the
embedding is constructed for the whole manifold at once; in the second, the
idea of a junction of solutions, obtained separately for areas inside and
outside the dust ball, is used. In the framework of the first approach, a
global smooth embedding in 7D space with a signature (2 + 5) was constructed.
It corresponds to the formation of the horizon as a result of matter falling
from infinity. The second approach generally leads to an embedding in 7D space
with the signature (1 + 6). This embedding corresponds to the case when matter
flies out of a white hole with the disappearance of its horizon, after which
the radius of the dust ball reaches its maximum, and then a collapse occurs
with the formation of the horizon of a black hole. The embedding obtained is
not smooth everywhere --- it contains a kink on the edge of the dust ball, and
{also, it is} not quite global. In the particular case, when the maximum radius
of the dust ball coincides with the radius of the horizon, it is possible to
construct a global smooth embedding in a flat 6D space with a signature (1 +

the initialization for such optimizers is usually carried out randomly.
However, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance
of such algorithms. This paper presents a systematic comparison of 22 different
initialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers:
differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search
(CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). We have
used 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to
compare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the
numbers of iterations. Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\%
of the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for
different initialization methods, while 73.68\% of the functions using both PSO
and CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization
methods. The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization,
while both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. In addition, under
the condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the
population size can also have a strong effect. Particle swarm optimization
usually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a
small population size. Differential evolution depends more heavily on the
number of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can
lead to better results. Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization,
while such initialization has little effect on GA. Some probability
distributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and
Rayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance. The implications
of this study and further research topics are also discussed in detail.

networks include the Internet, epidemic disease networks, transport networks,
power grids, protein-folding structures and others. Network integrity and
robustness are important to ensure that crucial networks are protected and
undesired harmful networks can be dismantled. Network structure and integrity
can be controlled by a set of key nodes, and to find the optimal combination of
nodes in a network to ensure network structure and integrity can be an
NP-complete problem. Despite extensive studies, existing methods have many
limitations and there are still many unresolved problems. This paper presents a
probabilistic approach based on neighborhood information and node importance,
namely, neighborhood information-based probabilistic algorithm (NIPA). We also
define a new centrality-based importance measure (IM), which combines the
contribution ratios of the neighbor nodes of each target node and two-hop node
information. Our proposed NIPA has been tested for different network benchmarks
and compared with three other methods: optimal attack strategy (OAS), high
betweenness first (HBF) and high degree first (HDF). Experiments suggest that
the proposed NIPA is most effective among all four methods. In general, NIPA
can identify the most crucial node combination with higher effectiveness, and
the set of optimal key nodes found by our proposed NIPA is much smaller than
that by heuristic centrality prediction. In addition, many previously neglected
weakly connected nodes are identified, which become a crucial part of the newly
identified optimal nodes. Thus, revised strategies for protection are

electron scattering data and this classic value has been used in the standard
dipole parameterization of the form factor. In trying to reproduce this classic
result, we discovered that there was a sign error in the original analysis and
that the authors should have found a value of $0.851(19)~\mathrm{fm}$. We
additionally made use of modern computing power to find a robust function for
extracting the radius using this 1963 data's spacing and uncertainty. This
optimal function, the Pad\'{e} $(0,1)$ approximant, also gives a result which
is consistent with the modern high precision proton radius extractions.

  model of Krabbe disease","  Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare demyelinating sphingolipidosis, often fatal in
the first years of life. It is caused by the inactivation of the
galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme that causes an increase in the cellular
levels of psychosine considered to be at the origin of the tissue-level
effects. GALC is inactivated also in the Twitcher (TWI) mouse: a genetic model
of KD that is providing important insights into the understating of the
pathogenetic process and the development of possible treatments. In this
article an innovative optical technique, RP-CARS, is proposed as a tool to
study the degree of order of the CH2 bonds inside the myelin sheaths of
TWI-mice sciatic-nerve fibres. RP-CARS, a recently developed variation of CARS
microscopy, is able to combine the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS
microscopy with molecular-bond-spatial-orientation sensibility. This is the
first time RP-CARS is applied to the study of a genetic model of a pathology,
leading to the demonstration of a post-onset progressive spatial
disorganization of the myelin CH2 bonds. The presented result could be of great
interest for a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the
human KD and, moreover, it is an additional proof of the experimental validity
of this microscopy technique.

B-splines with free knots. Since its performance strongly depends on the
initial estimation of the free parameters (i.e. the knots), we also propose a
fast and efficient knot-prediction algorithm that utilizes numerical properties
of first-order B-splines. Using $\ell_p\;(p=1,2,\infty)$ norm solutions, we
also provide three different strategies for properly selecting the free knots.
Our initial predictions are then iteratively refined by means of a
gradient-based variable projection optimization. Our method is general in
nature and can be used to estimate the optimal number of knots in cases in
which no a-priori information is available. To evaluate the performance of our
method, we approximated a one-dimensional discrete time series and conducted an
extensive comparative study using both synthetic and real-world data. We chose
the problem of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal compression as a real-world case
study. Our experiments on the well-known PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database
show that the proposed method outperforms other knot-prediction techniques in
terms of accuracy while requiring much lower computational complexity.

$\mathbb{N}^n$ that is compatible with the additive structure. If $\Bbbk$ is a
field, and $I$ is a \emph{binomial ideal} in $\Bbbk[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ (that is,
an ideal generated by polynomials with at most two terms), then $I$ induces a
congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ by declaring $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ to be
equivalent if there is a linear combination with nonzero coefficients of
$\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{u}}$ and $\mathbf{X}^{\mathbf{v}}$ that belongs to $I$.
While every congruence on $\mathbb{N}^n$ arises this way, this is not a
one-to-one correspondence, as many binomial ideals may induce the same
congruence. Nevertheless, the link between a binomial ideal and its
corresponding congruence is strong, and one may think of congruences as the
underlying combinatorial structures of binomial ideals. In the current
literature, the theories of binomial ideals and congruences on $\mathbb{N}^n$
are developed separately. The aim of this survey paper is to provide a detailed
parallel exposition, that provides algebraic intuition for the combinatorial
analysis of congruences. For the elaboration of this survey paper, we followed

primary route for the realization of a wide range of new materials.
Crystallization rates are also considered to be useful probes of glass-forming
ability. At the microscopic level, crystallization is described by the
classical crystal nucleation and growth theories, yet in general solid
formation is a far more complex process. In particular, the observation of
apparently different crystal growth regimes in many binary liquid mixtures
greatly challenges our understanding of crystallization. Here, we study by
experiments, theory and computer simulations the crystallization of supercooled
mixtures of argon and krypton, showing that crystal growth rates in these
systems can be reconciled with existing crystal growth models only by
explicitly accounting for the non-ideality of the mixtures. Our results
highlight the importance of thermodynamic aspects in describing the crystal
growth kinetics, providing a substantial step towards a more sophisticated
theory of crystal growth.

protein enables a biocompass is still under debate, mainly because of the
absence of permanent magnetism in the magnetic protein at room temperature.
Here, based on a widely accepted radical pair model of a biocompass, we propose
a microscopic mechanism that allows the biocompass to operate without a finite
magnetization of the magnetic protein in a biological environment. With the
structure of the magnetic protein, we show that the magnetic fluctuation,
rather than the permanent magnetism, of the magnetic protein can enable
geomagnetic field sensing. An analysis of the quantum dynamics of our
microscopic model reveals the necessary conditions for optimal sensitivity. Our
work clarifies the mechanism by which magnetic protein enables a biocompass.

to resolve instrumental biases through calibration. One common technique used
in high contrast imaging is angular differential imaging, which calibrates the
point spread function and flux leakage using a rotation in the focal plane.
  Our aim is to experimentally demonstrate and validate the efficacy of an
angular differential kernel-phase approach, a new method for self-calibrating
interferometric observables that operates similarly to angular differential
imaging, while retaining their statistical properties.
  We used linear algebra to construct new observables that evolve outside of
the subspace spanned by static biases. On-sky observations of a binary star
with the SCExAO instrument at the Subaru telescope were used to demonstrate the
practicality of this technique. We used a classical approach on the same data
to compare the effectiveness of this method.
  The proposed method shows smaller and more Gaussian residuals compared to
classical calibration methods, while retaining compatibility with the
statistical tools available. We also provide a measurement of the stability of
the SCExAO instrument that is relevant to the application of the technique.
  Angular differential kernel phases provide a reliable method for calibrating
biased observables. Although the sensitivity at small separations is reduced
for small field rotations, the calibration is effectively improved and the
number of subjective choices is reduced.

  in the Magellanic Clouds","  (abridged)Variability is a key property of stars on the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB). Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss
rate of the star. The long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the
most prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. The reddest, most
obscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded large
variability surveys. Selection criteria are derived based on colour-colour and
colour-magnitude diagrams from the combination of VISTA Magellanic Cloud (VMC)
survey, Spitzer IRAC and AllWISE data. After eliminating LPVs with known
periods shorter than 450 days, a sample of 1299 candidate obscured AGB stars is
selected. K-band LCs are constructed combining the epoch photometry available
in the VMC survey with literature data, analysed for variability and fitted
with a single period sine curve to derive mean magnitudes, amplitudes and
periods. A subset of 254 stars are either new variables, or known variables
where the period we find is better determined than the literature value, or
longer than 1000 days. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these stars
are fitted to a large number of templates. For this purpose the SEDs and
Spitzer IRS spectra of some non-AGB stars are also fitted to have templates of
the most likely contaminants in the sample. A sample of 217 likely LPVs is
found. Thirty-four stars have periods longer than 1000 days although some of
them have alternative shorter periods. Mass-loss rates and luminosities are
estimated from the template fitting. Period-luminosity relations are presented
for C- and O-rich Miras that appear to be extensions of relations derived in
the literature for shorter periods. The fit for the C-stars is particularly
well defined (with 182 objects) and reads Mbol = (-2.27 \pm 0.20) log P + (1.45
\pm 0.54)mag with an rms of 0.41 mag.

the specific instrumental effects of MUSE Wide Field Mode (pixel size, internal

end-to-end simulations. Sensitivity to the main atmospheric and AO system
parameters was analysed and the code was re-optimised to account for the
sensitivity found. Finally, the optimised algorithm was tested and commissioned
using more than one year of on-sky MUSE data. We demonstrate with an on-sky
data analysis that our algorithm meets all the requirements imposed by the MUSE
scientists, namely an accuracy better than a few percent on the critical PSF
parameters including full width at half maximum and global PSF shape through
the kurtosis parameter of a Moffat function. The PSFR algorithm is publicly
available and is used routinely to assess the MUSE image quality for each
observation. It can be included in any post-processing activity which requires

  and fast edge cooling events","  In the present work a simple analytical approach is presented in order to
clarify the physics behind the edge current density behaviour of a hot plasma
entering in contact with a resistive conductor. When a plasma enters in contact
with a highly resistive wall, large current densities appear at the edge of the
plasma. The model shows that this edge current originates from the plasma
response, which attempts to conserve the poloidal magnetic flux ($\Psi$) when
the outer current is being lost. The loss of outer current is caused by the
high resistance of the outer current path compared to the plasma core
resistance. The resistance of the outer path may be given by plasma contact
with a very resistive structure or by a sudden decrease of the outer plasma
temperature (e.g. due to a partial thermal quench or due to a cold front
penetration caused by massive gas injection). For general plasma geometries and
current density profiles the model shows that given a small change of minor
radius ($\delta a$) the plasma current is conserved to first order ($\delta I_p
= 0 + \mathcal{O}(\delta a^2)$). This conservation comes from the fact that
total inductance remains constant ($\delta L = 0$) due to an exact compensation
of the change of external inductance with the change of internal inductance
($\delta L_\text{ext}+\delta L_\text{int} = 0$). As the total current is
conserved and the plasma volume is reduced, the edge safety factor drops
according to $q_a \propto a^2/I_p$. Finally the consistency of the resulting
analytical predictions is checked with the help of free-boundary MHD
simulations.

absorption coefficient and a small band gap, while being less toxic compared to
other metal chalcogenides. However, the limitations in growing atomically thin

to synthesize very thin and at the same time large nanosheets. Electrical
transport measurements show that these nanosheets can function as field-effect
transistors with high on/off ratio and p-type behavior. The temperature
dependency of the charge transport reveals that defects in the crystal are
responsible for the formation of holes as majority carriers. During
illumination with circularly polarized light, these crystals generate a
helicity dependent photocurrent at zero-volt bias, since their symmetry is
broken by asymmetric interfaces (substrate and vacuum). Further, the observed
circular photogalvanic effect shows a pronounced in-plane anisotropy, with a
higher photocurrent along the armchair direction, originating from the higher
absorption coefficient in this direction. Our new insights show the potential
of tin sulfide for new functionalities in electronics and optoelectronics, for
instance as polarization sensors.

such as protostellar disks, circumstellar envelopes, or molecular clouds.
Methods. By considering the local anisotropy of the radiation field as the only
alignment mechanism, we can model the alignment of molecular or atomic species
inside a regular line radiative transfer simulation by only making use of the
converged output of this simulation. Calculations of the aligned molecular or
atomic states can subsequently be used to ray trace the polarized maps of the
three-dimensional simulation. Results. We present a three-dimensional radiative
transfer code, POlarized Radiative Transfer Adapted to Lines (PORTAL), that can
simulate the emergence of polarization in line emission through a magnetic
field of arbitrary morphology. Our model can be used in stand-alone mode,
assuming LTE excitation, but it is best used when processing the output of
regular three-dimensional (nonpolarized) line radiative transfer modeling
codes. We present the spectral polarization map of test cases of a collapsing
sphere and protoplanetary disk for multiple three-dimensional magnetic field
morphologies.

  simulations and laboratory experiments","  Fewer than 1% of all exoplanets detected to date have been characterized on
the basis of spectroscopic observations of their atmosphere. Unlike indirect
methods, high-contrast imaging offers access to atmospheric signatures by
separating the light of a faint off-axis source from that of its parent star.
Forthcoming space facilities, such as WFIRST/LUVOIR/HabEX, are expected to use
coronagraphic instruments capable of imaging and spectroscopy in order to
understand the physical properties of remote worlds. The primary technological
challenge that drives the design of these instruments involves the precision
control of wavefront phase and amplitude errors. Several FPWS and control
techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in laboratory to achieve the
required accuracy. However, these techniques have never been tested and
compared under the same laboratory conditions. This paper compares two of these
techniques in a closed loop in visible light: the pair-wise (PW) associated
with electric field conjugation (EFC) and self-coherent camera (SCC). We first
ran numerical simulations to optimize PW wavefront sensing and to predict the
performance of a coronagraphic instrument with PW associated to EFC wavefront
control, assuming modeling errors for both PW and EFC. Then we implemented the
techniques on a laboratory testbed. We introduced known aberrations into the
system and compared the wavefront sensing using both PW and SCC. The speckle
intensity in the coronagraphic image was then minimized using PW+EFC and SCC
independently. We demonstrate that both SCC and PW+EFC can generate a dark hole
in space-like conditions in a few iterations. Both techniques reach the current
limitation of our laboratory bench and provide coronagraphic contrast levels of
5e-9 in a narrow spectral band (<0.25% bandwidth)

ultrastructure of biological samples for subsequent microscopy analysis. This
process could be performed with various methods, each one affecting differently
the biological structure of the sample. While these alterations were

technique derived from CARS microscopy that allows probing spatial orientation
of molecular bonds while maintaining the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS

we show that the combination of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde can be
effectively employed as a fixative for RP-CARS microscopy, as long as the

using an exact solution to the Klein-Gordon equation with a point source
initial condition. We show that in both the propagation, and Klein-tunneling
regimes, the Zitterbewegung effect manifests itself as a series of quantum
beats of the particle density in the long-time limit. We demonstrate that the
beating phenomenon is characterized by the Zitterbewegung frequency, and that
the amplitude of these oscillations decays as $t^{-3/2}$. We show that beating
effect also manifests itself in the free Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations
within a quantum shutter setup, which involve the dynamics of cut-off quantum
states. We also find a time-domain where the particle density of the point
source is governed by the propagation of a main wavefront, exhibiting an
oscillating pattern similar to the diffraction in time phenomenon observed in
non-relativistic systems. The relative positions of these wavefronts are used
to investigate the time-delay of quantum waves in the Klein-tunneling regime.
We show that, depending on the energy difference, ${\cal E}$, between the
source and the potential step, the time-delay can be positive, negative or
zero. The latter case corresponds to a super-Klein-tunneling configuration,
where ${\cal E}$ equals to half the energy of the potential step.

is a central challenge in condensed-matter physics. One approach is to use the
superconducting proximity effect (SPE) in heterostructures, where a topological
insulator contacted with a superconductor hosts an effective p-wave pairing by
the penetration of Cooper pairs across the interface. However, this approach
suffers a difficulty in accessing the topological interface buried deep beneath
the surface. Here, we propose an alternative approach to realize topological
superconductivity without SPE. In a Pb(111) thin film grown on TlBiSe2, we
discover that the Dirac-cone state of substrate TlBiSe2 migrates to the top
surface of Pb film and obtains an energy gap below the superconducting
transition temperature of Pb. This suggests that a BCS superconductor is
converted into a TSC by the topological proximity effect. Our discovery opens a
route to manipulate topological superconducting properties of materials.

  clustering","  Slender marine structures such as deep-water riser systems are continuously
exposed to currents leading to vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of the
structure. This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of
fatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great
importance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with
elastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural
and hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present
frequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been
computed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to
inconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements
and experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor
of 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra
constraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the
simplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive
parameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is
to demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy
by applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step
approach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed
to identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These
parameters will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal
hydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation
against measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters
will be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct
hydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the
clustering. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental
data.

While it is a known fact that voiced sounds and prosody are the most important

prediction analysis coefficients of a source speaker to the acoustic vector
space of the target speaker with a view to objectively determine the
contributions of the voiced, unvoiced and supra-segmental components of sounds
to the voice conversion model. Results showed that vowels 'a', 'i', 'o' have
the most significant contribution in the conversion success. The voiceless
sounds were also found to be most affected by the noisy training data. An
average noise level of 40 dB above the noise floor were found to degrade the
voice conversion success by 55.14 percent relative to the voiced sounds. The
result also shows that for cross-gender voice conversion, prosody conversion is
more significant in scenarios where a female is the target speaker.

at the Apache Point Observatory survey to derive the average dust attenuation
curve for subgalactic star-forming regions of local star-forming galaxies

We obtain a $D_n(4000)$-independent average attenuation curve for spaxels with
$1.1\leq D_n(4000)<1.3$, which is similar to the one derived from either local
starbursts or normal SFGs. We examine whether and how the shape of the average

For spaxels with $1.2\leq D_n(4000)<1.3$, we find no dependence on either local

However, for spaxels with younger stellar population ($1.1\leq D_n(4000)<1.2$),
shallower average attenuation curves are found for star-forming regions with
smaller stellar mass surface density, smaller star formation rate surface
density, or those residing in the outer region of galaxies. These results
emphasize the risk of using one single attenuation curve to correct the dust
reddening for all types of star-forming regions, especially for those with

  atmosphere of HD 209458 b","  HD 209458b is an exoplanet with an upper atmosphere undergoing blow-off
escape that has mainly been studied using measurements of the Ly-alpha
absorption. Recently, high-resolution measurements of absorption in the He I
triplet line at 10830 angstroms of several exoplanets (including HD 209458b)
have been reported, creating a new opportunity to probe escaping atmospheres.
We aim to better understand the atmospheric regions of HD 209458b from where
the escape originates. We developed a 1D hydrodynamic model with spherical
symmetry for the HD 209458 b thermosphere coupled with a non-local
thermodynamic model for the population of the He triplet state. In addition, we
performed high-resolution radiative transfer calculations of synthetic spectra
for the He triplet lines and compared them with the measured absorption
spectrum in order to retrieve information about the atmospheric parameters. We
find that the measured spectrum constrains the [H]/[H$^{+}$] transition
altitude occurring in the range of 1.2 to 1.9Rp. H is almost fully ionised at
altitudes above 2.9Rp. We also find that the X-ray and EUV absorption takes
place at effective radii from 1.16 to 1.30Rp, and that the He triplet peak
density occurs at altitudes from 1.04 to 1.60Rp. Additionally, the averaged mmw
is confined to the 0.61-0.73 g/mole interval, and the thermospheric H/He ratio
should be larger than 90/10, and most likely approximately 98/2. We also
provide a one-to-one relationship between mass-loss rate and temperature. Based
on the energy-limited escape approach and assuming heating efficiencies of
0.1-0.2, we find a mass-loss rate in the range of (0.42-1.00)$\times 10^{11}$
g/s and a corresponding temperature range of 7125 to 8125K. The analysis of the
measured He triplet absorption spectrum significantly constrains the
thermospheric structure of HD 209458b and advances our knowledge of its
escaping atmosphere.

satellite systems, and relatively large moons are thought to be born in
circumplanetary disks. Making a single-moon system is known to be more
difficult than multiple-moon or moonless systems. We aim to find a way to form
a system with a single large moon, such as Titan around Saturn. We examine the
orbital migration of moons, which change their direction and speed depending on
the properties of circumplanetary disks. We modeled dissipating circumplanetary
disks with taking the effect of temperature structures into account and
calculated the orbital evolution of Titan-mass satellites in the final
evolution stage of various circumplanetary disks. We also performed N-body
simulations of systems that initially had multiple satellites to see whether
single-moon systems remained at the end. The radial slope of the
disk-temperature structure characterized by the dust opacity produces a patch
of orbits in which the Titan-mass moons cease inward migration and even migrate
outward in a certain range of the disk viscosity. The patch assists moons
initially located in the outer orbits to remain in the disk, while those in the
inner orbits fall onto the planet. We demonstrate for the first time that
systems can form that have only one large moon around giant planet. Our N-body
simulations suggest satellite formation was not efficient in the outer radii of
circumplanetary disks.

  Criticality Systems","  Different scheduling algorithms for mixed criticality systems have been
recently proposed. The common denominator of these algorithms is to discard low
critical tasks whenever high critical tasks are in lack of computation
resources. This is achieved upon a switch of the scheduling mode from Normal to
Critical. We distinguish two main categories of the algorithms: system-level
mode switch and task-level mode switch. System-level mode algorithms allow low
criticality (LC) tasks to execute only in normal mode. Task-level mode switch
algorithms enable to switch the mode of an individual high criticality task
(HC), from low (LO) to high (HI), to obtain priority over all LC tasks. This
paper investigates an online scheduling algorithm for mixed-criticality systems
that supports dynamic mode switches for both task level and system level. When
a HC task job overruns its LC budget, then only that particular job is switched
to HI mode. If the job cannot be accommodated, then the system switches to
Critical mode. To accommodate for resource availability of the HC jobs, the LC
tasks are degraded by stretching their periods until the Critical mode
exhibiting job complete its execution. The stretching will be carried out until
the resource availability is met. We have mechanized and implemented the
proposed algorithm using Uppaal. To study the efficiency of our scheduling
algorithm, we examine a case study and compare our results to the state of the
art algorithms.

  Systems","  Many existing studies on mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling assume that
low-criticality budgets for high-criticality applications are known apriori.
These budgets are primarily used as guidance to determine when the scheduler
should switch the system mode from low to high. Based on this key observation,
in this paper we propose a dynamic MC scheduling model under which
low-criticality budgets for individual high-criticality applications are
determined at runtime as opposed to being fixed offline. To ensure sufficient
budget for high-criticality applications at all times, we use offline
schedulability analysis to determine a system-wide total low-criticality budget
allocation for all the high-criticality applications combined. This total
budget is used as guidance in our model to determine the need for a
mode-switch. The runtime strategy then distributes this total budget among the
various applications depending on their execution requirement and with the
objective of postponing mode-switch as much as possible. We show that this
runtime strategy is able to postpone mode-switches for a longer time than any
strategy that uses a fixed low-criticality budget allocation for each
application. Finally, since we are able to control the total budget allocation
for high-criticality applications before mode-switch, we also propose
techniques to determine these budgets considering system-wide objectives such
as schedulability and service guarantee for low-criticality applications.

  Multiprocessors","  In this paper we consider the problem of mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling of
implicit-deadline sporadic task systems on a homogenous multiprocessor
platform. Focusing on dual-criticality systems, algorithms based on the fluid
scheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms use a
dual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the
system mode. Once the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the
execution rates of such tasks are increased to meet their increased demand.
Although these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable to schedule
several feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed
execution rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not
efficient to handle the high variability in demand during the transition period
immediately following the mode switch. This demand variability exists as long
as the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before
the mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a
multi-rate fluid execution model for dual-criticality task systems in this
paper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks are allocated varying execution
rates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently handle the
demand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed
model and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further,
we also present a speed-up optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate
model, and experimentally show that the proposed model outperforms all the
existing MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.

2003.05226v1,2020-03-11,2020-03-11,Phase mixing and wave heating in a complex coronal plasma,"  Aims. We investigate the formation of small scales and the dissipation of MHD
wave energy through non-linear interactions of counter-propagating, phase-mixed
Alfvenic waves in a complex magnetic field. Methods. We conducted fully 3-D,
non-ideal MHD simulations of transverse waves in complex magnetic fields.
Continuous wave drivers were imposed on the foot points of magnetic field lines
and the system was evolved for several Alfven travel times. Phase-mixed waves
were allowed to reflect off the upper boundary and the interactions between the
resultant counter-streaming wave packets were analysed. Results. The complex
nature of the background magnetic field encourages the development of phase
mixing, leading to a growth in currents and vorticities. Counter-propagating
phase-mixed waves induce a cascade of energy to small scales and result in more
efficient energy dissipation. This effect is enhanced in simulations with more
complex magnetic fields. High-frequency drivers excite localised field line
resonances and produce efficient wave heating. However, this relies on the
formation of large amplitude oscillations on resonant field lines. Drivers with
smaller frequencies than the fundamental frequencies of field lines are not
able to excite resonances and thus do not inject sufficient Poynting flux to
power coronal heating. Even in the case of high-frequency oscillations, the
rate of dissipation is likely too slow to balance coronal energy losses, even
within the quiet Sun. Conclusions. For the generalised phase-mixing presented
here, complex background field structures enhance the rate of wave energy
dissipation. However, it remains difficult for realistic wave drivers to inject
sufficient Poynting flux to heat the corona. Indeed, significant heating only
occurs in cases which exhibit amplitudes that are much larger than those
currently observed in the solar atmosphere.

  Cross-domain Learning","  With the rapid development of smart cities, smart buildings are generating a
massive amount of building sensing data by the equipped sensors. Indeed,
building sensing data provides a promising way to enrich a series of
data-demanding and cost-expensive urban mobile applications. In this paper, we
study how to reuse building sensing data to predict traffic volume on nearby
roads. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to achieve accurate prediction on such
cross-domain data with two major challenges. First, relationships between
building sensing data and traffic data are not unknown as prior, and the
spatio-temporal complexities impose more difficulties to uncover the underlying
reasons behind the above relationships. Second, it is even more daunting to
accurately predict traffic volume with dynamic building-traffic correlations,
which are cross-domain, non-linear, and time-varying. To address the above
challenges, we design and implement BuildSenSys, a first-of-its-kind system for
nearby traffic volume prediction by reusing building sensing data. First, we
conduct a comprehensive building-traffic analysis based on multi-source
datasets, disclosing how and why building sensing data is correlated with
nearby traffic volume. Second, we propose a novel recurrent neural network for
traffic volume prediction based on cross-domain learning with two attention
mechanisms. Specifically, a cross-domain attention mechanism captures the
building-traffic correlations and adaptively extracts the most relevant
building sensing data at each predicting step. Then, a temporal attention
mechanism is employed to model the temporal dependencies of data across
historical time intervals. The extensive experimental studies demonstrate that
BuildSenSys outperforms all baseline methods with up to 65.3% accuracy
improvement (e.g., 2.2% MAPE) in predicting nearby traffic volume.

to two different instruments on the same guide. For this purpose, we use Monte
Carlo simulations utilizing McStas software to check the efficiency of thermal
neutron transport for different basic configuration and sources. By considering
these results, it is possible to conclude that the split guide configuration
is, in most cases, more efficient than cases that use transmitted neutron beams
independently of source. We also verify that the employment of different
coating indexes for concave and convex surfaces on curved guides is crucial, at
least on simulated cases, to optimise neutron flux (intensity and divergence)
and diminish facility installation cost.

  Systems (KOS): An analysis of concepts and relations","  This study considers the expressiveness (that is the expressive power or
expressivity) of different types of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) and
discusses its potential to be machine-processable in the context of the
Semantic Web. For this purpose, the theoretical foundations of KOS are reviewed
based on conceptualizations introduced by the Functional Requirements for
Subject Authority Data (FRSAD) and the Simple Knowledge Organization System
(SKOS); natural language processing techniques are also implemented. Applying a
comparative analysis, the dataset comprises a thesaurus (Eurovoc), a subject
headings system (LCSH) and a classification scheme (DDC). These are compared
with an ontology (CIDOC-CRM) by focusing on how they define and handle concepts
and relations. It was observed that LCSH and DDC focus on the formalism of
character strings (nomens) rather than on the modelling of semantics; their
definition of what constitutes a concept is quite fuzzy, and they comprise a
large number of complex concepts. By contrast, thesauri have a coherent
definition of what constitutes a concept, and apply a systematic approach to
the modelling of relations. Ontologies explicitly define diverse types of
relations, and are by their nature machine-processable. The paper concludes
that the potential of both the expressiveness and machine processability of
each KOS is extensively regulated by its structural rules. It is harder to
represent subject headings and classification schemes as semantic networks with
nodes and arcs, while thesauri are more suitable for such a representation. In
addition, a paradigm shift is revealed which focuses on the modelling of
relations between concepts, rather than the concepts themselves.

spheroidal satellite candidate Triangulum II with the MAGIC telescopes from
62.4 hours of good-quality data taken between August 2016 and August 2017. We
find no gamma-ray excess in the direction of Triangulum II, and upper limits on
both the differential and integral gamma-ray flux are presented. Currently, the
kinematics of Triangulum II are affected by large uncertainties leading to a
bias in the determination of the properties of its dark matter halo. Using a
scaling relation between the annihilation J-factor and heliocentric distance of
well-known dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we estimate an annihilation J-factor for
Triangulum II for WIMP dark matter of $\log[J_{\text{ann}}({0.5^{\circ}})/$

profile for the object relying on results from resolved simulations of Milky

thermally averaged annihilation cross section for WIMP annihilation into
various Standard Model channels. The most stringent limits are obtained in the
$\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ final state, where a cross section for annihilation down to
$\langle \sigma_{\text{ann}} v \rangle = 3.05 \times 10^{-24}$ cm$^{3}$

repositories such as fault-prone module detection or evolutionary coupling
identification. An existing technique named Historage converts a Git repository
of a Java project to a finer-grained one. In a finer-grained repository, each
Java method exists as a single file. Treating Java methods as files has an
advantage, which is that Java methods can be tracked with Git mechanisms. The
biggest benefit of tracking methods with Git mechanisms is that it can easily
connect with any other tools and techniques build on Git infrastructure.
However, Historage's tracking has an issue of accuracy, especially on small
methods. More concretely, in the case that a small method is renamed or moved
to another class, Historage has a limited capability to track the method. In
this paper, we propose a new technique, FinerGit, to improve the trackability
of Java methods with Git mechanisms. We implement FinerGit as a system and
apply it to 182 open source software projects, which include 1,768K methods in
total. The experimental results show that our tool has a higher capability of
tracking methods in the case that methods are renamed or moved to other
classes.

multi-planet systems have highlighted the existence of an anticorrelation
between the average orbital eccentricity of planets and the number of planets
of their host system, that is, its multiplicity. This effect was proposed to
reflect the varying levels of violence in the dynamical evolution of planetary
systems. Previous work suggested that the relative violence of the dynamical
evolution of planetary systems with similar orbital architectures can be
compared through the computation of their angular momentum deficit (AMD). We
investigated the possibility of using a more general metric to perform
analogous comparisons between planetary systems with different orbital
architectures. We considered a modified version of the AMD, the normalized
angular momentum deficit (NAMD), and used it to study a sample of 99
multi-planet systems containing both the currently best-characterized
extrasolar systems and the solar system, that is, planetary systems with both
compact and wide orbital architectures. We verified that the NAMD allows us to
compare the violence of the dynamical histories of multi-planet systems with
different orbital architectures. We identified an anticorrelation between the
NAMD and the multiplicity of the planetary systems, of which the previously
observed eccentricity-multiplicity anticorrelation is a reflection. Our results
seem to indicate that phases of dynamical instabilities and chaotic evolution
are not uncommon among planetary systems. They also suggest that the efficiency
of the planetary formation process in producing high-multiplicity systems is
likely to be higher than that suggested by their currently known population.

first GRAVITY/VLTI observations at high spectral (R=4000) and spatial (mas)
resolution of the CO overtone transitions in NGC 2024 IRS2. The continuum
emission is resolved in all baselines and is slightly asymmetric, displaying
small closure phases ($\leq$8$^{\circ}$). Our best ellipsoid model provides a
disc inclination of 34$^{\circ}$$\pm$1$^{\circ}$, a disc major axis position
angle of 166$^{\circ}$$\pm$1$^{\circ}$, and a disc diameter of 3.99$\pm$0.09
mas (or 1.69$\pm$0.04 au, at a distance of 423 pc). The small closure phase
signals in the continuum are modelled with a skewed rim, originating from a
pure inclination effect. For the first time, our observations spatially and
spectrally resolve the first four CO bandheads. Changes in visibility, as well
as differential and closure phases across the bandheads are detected. Both the
size and geometry of the CO-emitting region are determined by fitting a
bidimensional Gaussian to the continuum-compensated CO bandhead visibilities.

  Entity Linking","  A typical architecture for end-to-end entity linking systems consists of
three steps: mention detection, candidate generation and entity disambiguation.
In this study we investigate the following questions: (a) Can all those steps
be learned jointly with a model for contextualized text-representations, i.e.
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)? (b) How much entity knowledge is already contained
in pretrained BERT? (c) Does additional entity knowledge improve BERT's
performance in downstream tasks? To this end, we propose an extreme
simplification of the entity linking setup that works surprisingly well: simply
cast it as a per token classification over the entire entity vocabulary (over
700K classes in our case). We show on an entity linking benchmark that (i) this
model improves the entity representations over plain BERT, (ii) that it
outperforms entity linking architectures that optimize the tasks separately and
(iii) that it only comes second to the current state-of-the-art that does
mention detection and entity disambiguation jointly. Additionally, we
investigate the usefulness of entity-aware token-representations in the
text-understanding benchmark GLUE, as well as the question answering benchmarks
SQUAD V2 and SWAG and also the EN-DE WMT14 machine translation benchmark. To
our surprise, we find that most of those benchmarks do not benefit from
additional entity knowledge, except for a task with very small training data,
the RTE task in GLUE, which improves by 2%.

  massive gravity","  On the basis of the state parameter of de Sitter space-time satisfying the
first law of thermodynamics,we can derive some effective thermodynamic
quantities.When the temperature of the black hole horizon is equal to that of
the cosmological horizon, we think that the effective temperature of the
space-time should have the same value. Using this condition, we obtain a
differential equation of the entropy of the de Sitter black hole in the
higherdimensional de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity. Solving
the differential equation, we obtain the corrected entropy and effective
thermodynamic quantities of the de Sitter black hole. The results show that for
multiparameter black holes, the entropy satisfied differential equation is
invariable with different independent state parameters. Therefore, the entropy
of higher-dimensional dS black holes in dRGT massive gravity is only a function
of the position of the black hole horizon, and is independent of other state
parameters. It is consistent with the corresponding entropy of the black hole
horizon and the cosmological horizon. The thermodynamic quantities of
self-consistent de Sitter spacetime are given theoretically, and the equivalent
thermodynamic quantities have the second-order phase transformation similar to
AdS black hole, but unlike AdS black hole, the equivalent temperature of de
Sitter space-time has a maximum value. By satisfying the requirement of
thermodynamic equilibrium and stability of space-time, the conditions for the
existence of dS black holes in the universe are obtained.

of the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS). We found 5740 bodies (mostly Main
Belt asteroids), 1203 of which were detected in different nights and in $g'$
and $r'$. Objects were linked in the barycenter system and their orbital
parameters were computed assuming Keplerian motion. We identified 6 near Earth
objects, 1738 Main Belt asteroids and 4 Trans-Neptunian objects. We did not
find a $g'-r'$ color-size correlation for $14<H_{g'}<18$ ($1<D<10$ km)
asteroids. We show asteroids' colors are disturbed by HiTS' 1.6 hour cadence
and estimate that observations should be separated by at most 14 minutes to
avoid confusion in future wide-field surveys like LSST. The size distribution
for the Main Belt objects can be characterized as a simple power law with slope
$\sim0.9$, steeper than in any other survey, while data from HiTS 2014's
campaign is consistent with previous ones (slopes $\sim0.68$ at the bright end
and $\sim0.34$ at the faint end). This difference is likely due to the ecliptic
distribution of the Main Belt since 2015's campaign surveyed farther from the
ecliptic than did 2014's and most previous surveys.

the gamma-ray band over multiple years. However, recent Fermi-Large Area
Telescope observations indicate elevated activity during 2015-2019. We aim at
constraining the origin of the gamma-ray outbursts towards 3C273 and
investigate their connection to the parsec-scale jet. We generate Fermi-LAT
gamma-ray light curves with multiple binning intervals and study the spectral
properties of the gamma-ray emission. Using a 3-mm ALMA light curve, we study
the correlation between radio and gamma-ray emission. Relevant activity in the
parsec-scale jet of 3C273 is investigated with 7-mm VLBA observations obtained
close in time to notable gamma-ray outbursts. We find two prominent gamma-ray
outbursts in 2016 (MJD 57382) and 2017 (MJD 57883) accompanied by mm-wavelength
flaring activity. The gamma-ray photon index time series show a weak hump-like

alleviates the high memory and prediction time costs of distance-based anomaly

  flaring rate confirmed","  The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is located at the
dynamical center of the Milky Way. In a recent study of the X-ray flaring
activity from Sgr A* using Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift data from 1999 to
2015, it has been argued that the bright flaring rate has increased from 2014
Aug. 31 while the faint flaring rate decreased from around 2013 Aug. We tested
the persistence of these changes in the flaring rates with new X-ray data of
Sgr A* obtained in 2016-2018 (total exposure of 1.4Ms). We detected 9 flares in
the Chandra data and 5 flares in the Swift data that we added to the set of 107
previously detected flares. We computed the intrinsic distribution of flare
fluxes and durations corrected for the sensitivity bias using a new method that
allowed us to take the error on the flare fluxes and durations into account.
From this intrinsic distribution, we determined the average flare detection
efficiency for each Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift observation. After
correcting each observational exposure for this efficiency, we applied the
Bayesian blocks algorithm on the concatenated flare arrival times. As in the
above-mentioned study, we also searched for a flux and fluence threshold that
might lead to a change in flaring rate. We improved the previous method by
computing the average flare detection efficiencies for each flux and fluence
range. The Bayesian block algorithm did not detect any significant change in
flaring rate of the 121 flares. However, we detected an increase by a factor of
about three in the flaring rate of the most luminous and most energetic flares
that have occurred since 2014 Aug. 30. The X-ray activity of Sgr A* has
increased for more than four years. Additional studies about the overall
near-infrared and radio behavior of Sgr A* are required to draw strong results
on the multiwavelength activity of the black hole.

2003.06198v1,2020-03-13,2020-03-13,Hunting for hot corinos and WCCC sources in the OMC-2/3 filament,"  Context: Solar-like protostars are known to be chemically rich, but it is not
yet clear how much their chemical composition can vary and why. So far, two
chemically distinct types of Solar-like protostars have been identified: hot
corinos, which are enriched in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs),
such as methanol (CH$_3$OH) or dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), and Warm Carbon
Chain Chemistry (WCCC) objects, which are enriched in carbon chain molecules,
such as butadiynyl (C$_4$H) or ethynyl radical (CCH). However, none of these
have been studied so far in environments similar to that in which our Sun was
born, that is, one that is close to massive stars. Aims: In this work, we
search for hot corinos and WCCC objects in the closest analogue to the Sun's
birth environment, the Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 (OMC-2/3) filament located in
the Orion A molecular cloud. Methods: We obtained single-dish observations of
CCH and CH$_3$OH line emission towards nine Solar-like protostars in this
region. As in other, similar studies of late, we used the [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH]
abundance ratio in order to determine the chemical nature of our protostar
sample. Results: Unexpectedly, we found that the observed methanol and ethynyl
radical emission (over a few thousands au scale) does not seem to originate
from the protostars but rather from the parental cloud and its
photo-dissociation region, illuminated by the OB stars of the region.
Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that caution should be taken before
using [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH] from single-dish observations as an indicator of the
protostellar chemical nature and that there is a need for other tracers or high
angular resolution observations for probing the inner protostellar layers.

binaries provides valuable insights into neutron star properties, such as their
spin period and magnetic field. However, most studies concentrate on relatively
old systems, where the neutron star is in its late propeller, accretor, or
nearly spin equilibrium phase. Here we use an analytic model from standard
accretion theory to illustrate the evolution of high-mass X-ray binaries early
in their life. We show that a young neutron star is unlikely to be an accretor
because of the long duration of ejector and propeller phases. We apply the
model to the recently discovered ~4000 yr old high-mass X-ray binary XMMU
J051342.6-672412 and find that the system's neutron star, with a tentative spin
period of 4.4 s, cannot be in the accretor phase and has a magnetic field B >
(a few)x10^13 G, which is comparable to the magnetic field of many older
high-mass X-ray binaries and is much higher than the spin equilibrium inferred
value of (a few)x10^11 G. The observed X-ray luminosity could be the result of
thermal emission from a young cooling magnetic neutron star or a small amount
of accretion that can occur in the propeller phase.

consisting of two honeycomb arrays of helical waveguides with opposite
directions of rotation in a focusing nonlinear optical medium. Zigzag edges of
two arrays placed in contact create a zigzag-zigzag interface between two
structures with different topology. A characteristic feature of such a photonic
insulator is that, in the linear limit, it simultaneously supports two
topologically protected chiral edge states at the interface between the two
arrays. In the presence of nonlinearity, either bright or dark scalar Floquet
edge soliton can bifurcate from a linear topological edge state. Such solitons
are unidirectional and are localized in both directions, along the interface
due to nonlinear self-action, and across the interface as being an edge state.
The presence of two edge states with equal averaged group velocities enables
the existence of stable topological vector edge solitons. In our case, these
are nonlinearly coupled bright and dark solitons bifurcating from different
branches of the topological Floquet edge states. Here we put forward a new
mathematical description of scalar and vector small-amplitude Floquet envelope
solitons in the above-mentioned continuous system. Importantly for the design
of future photonic devices based on Floquet edge solitons, we find that the
latter can be described by nonlinear Schrodinger equations for the mode
envelopes obtained by averaging over one rotation period in the evolution

analyzed in detail. It is definitively shown that the position and spin
operators in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation (but not in the Dirac one) are
quantum-mechanical counterparts of the classical position and spin variables.
The probabilistic interpretation is valid only for Foldy-Wouthuysen wave
functions. The relativistic spin operators are discussed. The spin-orbit
interaction does not exist for a free particle if the conventional operators of
the orbital angular momentum and the rest-frame spin are used. Alternative
definitions of the orbital angular momentum and the spin are based on
noncommutative geometry, do not satisfy standard commutation relations, and can
allow the spin-orbit interaction.

  vortex-Dirac fermion system","  Physics of topological materials have attracted much attention from both
physicists and mathematicians recently. The index and the fermion number of
Dirac fermions play an important role in topological insulators and topological
superconductors. A zero-energy mode exists when Dirac fermions couple to
objects with soliton-like structure such as kinks, vortices, monopoles, strings
and branes. We discuss a system of Dirac fermions interacting with a vortex and
a kink. This kind of systems will be realized on the surface of topological
insulators where Dirac fermions exist. The fermion number is fractionalized and
this is related to the presence of fermion zero-energy excitation modes. A
zero-energy mode can be regarded as a Majorana fermion mode when the chemical
potential vanishes. Our discussion includes the case where there is a half-flux
quantum vortex associated with a kink in a magnetic field in a bilayer
superconductor. A normalizable wave function of fermion zero-energy mode does
not exist in the core of the half-flux quantum vortex. The index of Dirac
operator and the fermion number have additional contributions when a soliton
scalar field has a singularity.

xenon at a pressure as low as 1.1 GPa, producing a novel van der Waals compound
XeAr2, which crystallizes in the MgCu2-type Laves phase structure. Due to the
pressure-induced delocalization of the electrons in outermost shells, the
covalent Xe-Xe and Xe-Ar bonds have been detected which lead XeAr2 to be
unexpectedly stable without any phase transition or decomposition at least up

  properties of vanadium and niobium","  It is believed that the density functional theory (DFT) describes most
elements with s, p and d orbitals very well, except some materials that having
strongly localized and correlated valence electrons. In this work, we find that
the widely employed exchange-correlation (xc) functionals, including LDA, GGA
and meta-GGA, underestimate the shear modulus and phase stability of V and Nb
greatly. The advanced hybrid functional that is usually better for correlated
system, on the other hand, completely fails in these two simple metals. This
striking failure is revealed due to the orbital localization error in GGA,
which is further deteriorated by hybrid functionals. This observation is
corroborated by a similar failure of DFT+U and van der Waals functionals when
applied to V and Nb. To remedy this problem, an semi-empirical approach of
DFT+J is proposed which can delocalize electrons by facilitating the on-site
exchange. Furthermore, it is observed that including density derivatives
slightly improves the performance of the semi-local functionals, with meta-GGA
outperforms GGA, and the latter is better than LDA. This discovery indicates
the possibility and necessity to include higher-order density derivatives
beyond the Laplacian level for the purpose to remove the orbital localization
error (mainly from d orbitals) and delocalization error (mainly from s and p
orbitals) completely in V and Nb, so that to achieve a better description of
their electronic structures. The same strategy can be applied to other d
electron system and f electron system.

  warm dense liquid hydrogen","  The properties of hydrogen at high pressure have wide implications in
astrophysics and high-pressure physics. Its phase change in the liquid is
variously described as a metallization, H2-dissociation, density discontinuity
or plasma phase transition. It has been tacitly assumed that these phenomena
coincide at a first-order liquid-liquid transition (LLT). In this work, the
relevant pressure-temperature conditions are thoroughly explored with
first-principles molecular dynamics. We show there is a large dependency on
exchange-correlation functional and significant finite size effects. We use
hysteresis in a number of measurable quantities to demonstrate a first-order
transition up to a critical point, above which molecular and atomic liquids are
indistinguishable. At higher temperature beyond the critical point,
H2-dissociation becomes a smooth cross-over in the supercritical region that
can be modelled by a pseudo-transition, where the H2-2H transformation is
localized and does not cause a density discontinuity at metallization.
Thermodynamic anomalies and counter-intuitive transport behavior of protons are
also discovered even far beyond the critical point, making this dissociative
transition highly relevant to the interior dynamics of Jovian planets. Below
the critical point, simulation also reveals a dynamic H2-2H chemical
equilibrium with rapid interconversion, showing that H2 and H are miscible. The
predicted critical temperature lies well below the ionization temperature. Our
calculations unequivocally demonstrate that there are three distinct regimes in
the liquid-liquid transition of warm dense hydrogen.

Using the first three-dimensional simulations of a convective dynamo based on a

rates. The dynamo instability saturates in the magnetostrophic regime with the
magnetic energy exceeding the kinetic energy by a factor of up to 10. Our
results are compatible with the observational constraints on galactic magnetar

2003.06679v1,2020-03-14,2020-03-14,Cohesive Networks using Delayed Self Reinforcement,"  How a network gets to the goal (a consensus value) can be as important as
reaching the consensus value. While prior methods focus on rapidly getting to a
new consensus value, maintaining cohesion, during the transition between
consensus values or during tracking, remains challenging and has not been
addressed. The main contributions of this work are to address the problem of
maintaining cohesion by: (i) proposing a new delayed self-reinforcement (DSR)
approach; (ii) extending it for use with agents that have higher-order,
heterogeneous dynamics, and (iii) developing stability conditions for the
DSR-based method. With DSR, each agent uses current and past information from
neighbors to infer the overall goal and modifies the update law to improve
cohesion. The advantages of the proposed DSR approach are that it only requires
already-available information from a given network to improve the cohesion and
does not require network-connectivity modifications (which might not be always
feasible) nor increases in the system's overall response speed (which can
require larger input). Moreover, illustrative simulation examples are used to
comparatively evaluate the performance with and without DSR. The simulation
results show substantial improvement in cohesion with DSR.

characteristic emission features in the 1.3 mm window of distinct regions in
the northern part of the Orion A molecular cloud. By defining and analysing
template regions, we also intend to help with the interpretation of
observations from more distant sources which cannot be easily spatially
resolved.
  Methods: We analyse an imaging line survey covering the area of OMC-1 to
OMC-3 from 200.2 to 281.8 GHz obtained with the PI230 receiver at the APEX
telescope. Masks are used to define regions with distinct properties (e.g.
column density or temperature ranges) from which we obtain averaged spectra.
Lines of 29 molecular species (55 isotopologues) are fitted for each region to
obtain the respective total intensity.
  Results: We find that strong sources like Orion KL have a clear impact on the
emission on larger scales. Although not spatially extended, their line emission
contributes substantially to spectra averaged over large regions. Conversely,
the emission signatures of dense, cold regions like OMC-2 and OMC-3 (e.g.
enhanced N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission and low HCN/HNC ratio) seem to be difficult to
pick up on larger scales, where they are eclipsed by signatures of stronger
sources. In all regions, HCO$^{+}$ appears to contribute between 3% and 6% to
the total intensity, the most stable value for all bright species.
N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ shows the strongest correlation with column density, but not
with typical high-density tracers like HCN, HCO$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, or HNC.
Common line ratios associated with UV illumination, CN/HNC and CN/HCO$^{+}$,
show ambiguous results on larger scales, suggesting that the identification of
UV illuminated material may be more challenging. The HCN/HNC ratio may be
related to temperature over varying scales.

  Nonlinearity","  The massive deployment of light-emitting diode (LED) lightning infrastructure
has opened the opportunity to reuse it as visible light communication (VLC) to
leverage the current RF spectrum crisis in indoor scenarios. One of the main
problems in VLC is the limited dynamic range of LEDs and their nonlinear
response, which may lead to a severe degradation in the communication, and more
specifically in the bit error rate (BER). This is aggravated by the extensive
usage of multicarrier multiplexing, based on optical orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (O-OFDM), characterized by a high peak-to-average power
ratio. Here, we present a chaos-based coded modulation (CCM) setup specifically
adapted to the LED nonlinearities. It replaces the usual modulation, while
keeping the multicarrier O-OFDM structure unchanged. First, we obtain a
semi-analytical bound for the bit error probability, taking into account the
LED nonlinear response. The bound results particularly tight for the range of
signal-to-noise ratio of interest. Then, we propose a method to design the
modulator based on optimization techniques. The objective function is the
semi-analytical bound, and the optimization is applied to a parameterization of
the CCM conjugation function. This appropriately shapes the chaotic waveform
and leads to BER improvements that outperform classical counterparts under
ideal predistortion.

atmospheric wind component from the ground up to stratospheric altitudes.
Planned explosions of old ammunition in Finland generate transient infrasound
waves that travel through the atmosphere. These waves are partially reflected
back towards the ground from stratospheric levels, and are detected at a
receiver station located in northern Norway at 178 km almost due North from the
explosion site. The difference between the true horizontal direction towards
the source and the backazimuth direction (the horizontal direction of arrival)
of the incoming infrasound wave-fronts, in combination with the pulse
propagation time, are exploited to provide an estimate of the average
cross-wind component in the penetrated atmosphere. We perform offline
assimilation experiments with an ensemble Kalman filter and these observations,
using the ERA5 ensemble reanalysis atmospheric product as background (prior)
for the wind at different vertical levels. We demonstrate that information from
both sources can be combined to obtain analysis (posterior) estimates of
cross-winds at different vertical levels of the atmospheric slice between the
explosion site and the recording station. The assimilation makes greatest
impact at the 12-60 km levels, with some changes with respect to the prior of
the order of 0.1-1.0 m/s, which is a magnitude larger than the typical standard
deviation of the ERA5 background. The reduction of background variance in the
higher levels often reached 2-5%. This is the first published study
demonstrating techniques to implement assimilation of infrasound data into
atmospheric models. It paves the way for further exploration in the use of
infrasound observations - especially natural and continuous sources - to probe

However, the traditional beam selection network suffers from significant

paper, we propose a phase shifter-aided beam selection network, which enables a
single RF chain to support multiple focused-energy beams, for mitigating the
beam squint in wideband mmWave MIMO systems. Based on this architecture, we
additionally design an efficient transmit precoder (TPC) for maximizing the
achievable sum-rate, which is composed of beam selection and beamspace
precoding. Specifically, we decouple the design problems of beamspace precoding
and beam selection by exploiting the fact that the beam selection matrix has a
limited number of candidates. For the beamspace precoding design, we propose a
successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based method, which decomposes the
associated optimization problem into a series of subproblems and solves them
successively. For the beam selection design, we propose an energy-max beam
selection method for avoiding the high complexity of exhaustive search, and
derive the number of required beams for striking an attractive trade-off

from a subsidiary magnetic field or electric current could help reduce the
power consumption in spintronic devices. When increasing temperature above room
temperature, FeRh displays an uncommon antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase
transition linked to a unit cell volume expansion. Thus, using the strain
exerted by an adjacent piezoelectric layer, the relative amount of
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic regions can be tuned by an electric field
applied to the piezoelectric material. Indeed, large variations in the
saturation magnetization have been observed when straining FeRh films grown on
suitable piezoelectric substrates. In view of its applications, the variations
in the remanent magnetization rather than those of the saturation magnetization
are the most relevant. Here, we show that in the absence of any bias external
magnetic field, permanent and reversible magnetization changes as high as 34%
can be induced by an electric field, which remain after this has been zeroed.
Bulk and local magnetoelectric characterization reveals that the fundamental
reason for the large magnetoelectric response observed at remanence is the
expansion (rather than the nucleation) of ferromagnetic nanoregions.

2004.08326v1,2020-04-17,2020-04-17,SpEx: Multi-Scale Time Domain Speaker Extraction Network,"  Speaker extraction aims to mimic humans' selective auditory attention by
extracting a target speaker's voice from a multi-talker environment. It is
common to perform the extraction in frequency-domain, and reconstruct the
time-domain signal from the extracted magnitude and estimated phase spectra.
However, such an approach is adversely affected by the inherent difficulty of
phase estimation. Inspired by Conv-TasNet, we propose a time-domain speaker
extraction network (SpEx) that converts the mixture speech into multi-scale
embedding coefficients instead of decomposing the speech signal into magnitude
and phase spectra. In this way, we avoid phase estimation. The SpEx network
consists of four network components, namely speaker encoder, speech encoder,
speaker extractor, and speech decoder. Specifically, the speech encoder
converts the mixture speech into multi-scale embedding coefficients, the
speaker encoder learns to represent the target speaker with a speaker
embedding. The speaker extractor takes the multi-scale embedding coefficients
and target speaker embedding as input and estimates a receptive mask. Finally,
the speech decoder reconstructs the target speaker's speech from the masked
embedding coefficients. We also propose a multi-task learning framework and a
multi-scale embedding implementation. Experimental results show that the
proposed SpEx achieves 37.3%, 37.7% and 15.0% relative improvements over the
best baseline in terms of signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), scale-invariant SDR
(SI-SDR), and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) under an open

  system","  Nonlocality and entanglement are not only the fundamental characteristics of
quantum mechanics but also important resources for quantum information and
computation applications. Exploiting the quantitative relationship between the
two different resources is of both theoretical and practical significance. The
common choice for quantifying the nonlocality of a two-qubit state is the
maximal violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. That for
entanglement is entanglement of formation, which is a function of the
concurrence. In this paper, we systematically investigate the quantitative
relationship between the entanglement and nonlocality of a general two-qubit
system. We rederive a known upper bound on the nonlocality of a general
two-qubit state, which depends on the state's entanglement. We investigate the
condition that the nonlocality of two different two-qubit states can be

  Programming-by-Demonstration Systems","  An important concern in end user development (EUD) is accidentally embedding
personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. This issue is
particularly important in GUI-based programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems
due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. Prior studies
reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in
EUD. We present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential
personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of
information entries with respect to the corresponding app GUI context. Compared
with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information
beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses
the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps
from any task domain. Our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on
the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency,
readability, robustness, and generalizability. Our evaluation shows that our
approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in
scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user
developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables
script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the
obfuscated fields.

fluids, the torques that produce turbulent vortices result from the loss of
symmetry of the stress tensor, once the viscous friction exceeds the shear
stress resistance of the fluid. In wall-bounded flows, in particular, the
turbulent vortices form in a thin layer of fluid adjacent to the wall,
practically coinciding with the so-called viscous sublayer, where the viscous
friction reaches the largest values. The present paper determines a vortex
structure for this sublayer, consistent with the well-known linearity of the
diagram of the mean streamwise velocity of this region. The analysis enables us
to calculate the diameter, angular velocity, and interaxis of the vortices in
the viscous sublayer in steady-state conditions. The lifting force that makes
the vortices migrate from the wall towards the mainstream flow is determined,
and the crucial role played by gyroscopic precession in the reorientation of
the vortex axis is discussed.

different eras. However, such cross-era comparison is often biased due to
significant changes in success factors underlying player achievement rates
(e.g. performance enhancing drugs and modern training regimens). Such
historical comparison is more than fodder for casual discussion among sports
fans, as it is also an issue of critical importance to the multi-billion dollar
professional sport industry and the institutions (e.g. Hall of Fame) charged
with preserving sports history and the legacy of outstanding players and
achievements. To address this cultural heritage management issue, we report an
objective statistical method for renormalizing career achievement metrics, one
that is particularly tailored for common seasonal performance metrics, which
are often aggregated into summary career metrics -- despite the fact that many
player careers span different eras. Remarkably, we find that the method applied
to comprehensive Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association
player data preserves the overall functional form of the distribution of career
achievement, both at the season and career level. As such, subsequent
re-ranking of the top-50 all-time records in MLB and the NBA using renormalized
metrics indicates reordering at the local rank level, as opposed to bulk
reordering by era. This local order refinement signals time-independent
mechanisms underlying annual and career achievement in professional sports,
meaning that appropriately renormalized achievement metrics can be used to
compare players from eras with different season lengths, team strategies, rules
-- and possibly even different sports.

  Learning and Deep Learning Models","  Prediction of future movement of stock prices has always been a challenging
task for the researchers. While the advocates of the efficient market
hypothesis (EMH) believe that it is impossible to design any predictive
framework that can accurately predict the movement of stock prices, there are
seminal work in the literature that have clearly demonstrated that the
seemingly random movement patterns in the time series of a stock price can be
predicted with a high level of accuracy. Design of such predictive models
requires choice of appropriate variables, right transformation methods of the
variables, and tuning of the parameters of the models. In this work, we present
a very robust and accurate framework of stock price prediction that consists of
an agglomeration of statistical, machine learning and deep learning models. We
use the daily stock price data, collected at five minutes interval of time, of
a very well known company that is listed in the National Stock Exchange (NSE)
of India. The granular data is aggregated into three slots in a day, and the
aggregated data is used for building and training the forecasting models. We
contend that the agglomerative approach of model building that uses a
combination of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, can
very effectively learn from the volatile and random movement patterns in a
stock price data. We build eight classification and eight regression models
based on statistical and machine learning approaches. In addition to these

is possible to observe coherent three-body oscillation of the populations of
collective states, which is of interest for developing new schemes of
three-qubit quantum gates controlled by an electric field.

provides a useful method for templating surface topography for a variety of
novel applications. Many experiments have studied wrinkle formation during the
compression of a rigid film on a relatively soft pre-strained elastic

can be considered semi-infinite relative to that of the film. As the relative
thickness of the substrate is decreased, the bending stiffness of the film
dominates, causing the bilayer to transition to either local wrinkling or a
global buckling instability. In this work optical microscopy was used to study
the critical parameters that determine the emergence of local wrinkling or
global buckling of freestanding bilayer films consisting of a thin rigid
polymer capping layer on a pre-strained elastomeric substrate. The thickness

used to create a buckling phase diagram which describes the behaviour of the

transmission between different sectors. We construct information flow networks
with the sectors as the nodes and the transfer entropy between them as the
corresponding edges. Then we adopt the maximum spanning arborescence (MSA) to
extracting important information flows and the hierarchical structure of the
networks. We find that, during the whole sample period, the \textit{composite}
sector is an information source of the whole stock market, while the
\textit{non-bank financial} sector is the information sink. We also find that
the \textit{non-bank finance}, \textit{bank}, \textit{computer},

work has important implications for market participants and policy makers in

intact derelict objects, i.e. payloads and rocket bodies, for ADR capture
methods selection. The ontology is defined on a minimal set of physical,
dynamical and statistical parameters of a target object. The practicality and
validity of the ontology are demonstrated by applying it onto a database of 30
representative objects, built by combining structured and unstructured data
from publicly available sources. The analysis of results proves the ontology
capable of inferring the most suited ADR capture methods for considered
objects. Furthermore, it confirms its ability to handle the input data from
different sources transparently, minimizing user input. The developed ontology
provides an initial step towards a more comprehensive knowledge representation
framework meant to improve data management and knowledge discovery in the
domain of space debris. Furthermore, it provides a tool that should make the
initial planning of future ADR missions simpler yet more systematic.

  Properties of Emission Lines and the Global Spectrum","  We present an unbiased spectroscopic study of the Galactic supernova remnant
(SNR) Cygnus Loop using the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) DR5. LAMOST features both a large field of view and a large
aperture, which allow us to simultaneously obtain 4000 spectra at
$\sim$3700-9000 \AA with R$\approx$1800. The Cygnus Loop is a prototype of
middle-aged SNRs, which has the advantages of being bright, large in angular
size, and relatively unobscured by dust. Along the line of sight to the Cygnus
Loop, 2747 LAMOST DR5 spectra are found in total, which are spatially
distributed over the entire remnant. This spectral sample is free of the
selection bias of most previous studies, which often focus on bright filaments
or regions bright in [O III]. Visual inspection verifies that 368 spectra
(13$\%$ of the total) show clear spectral features to confirm their association
with the remnant. In addition, 176 spectra with line emission show ambiguity of
their origin but have a possible association to the SNR. In particular, the 154
spectra dominated by the SNR emission are further analyzed by identifying
emission lines and measuring their intensities. We examine distributions of
physical properties such as electron density and temperature, which vary
significantly inside the remnant, using theoretical models. By combining a
large number of the LAMOST spectra, a global spectrum representing the Cygnus
Loop is constructed, which presents characteristics of radiative shocks.
Finally, we discuss the effect of the unbiased spectral sample on the global
spectrum and its implication to understand a spatially unresolved SNR in a
distant galaxy.

  Common Sense","  Recent progress in deep learning is essentially based on a ""big data for
small tasks"" paradigm, under which massive amounts of data are used to train a
classifier for a single narrow task. In this paper, we call for a shift that
flips this paradigm upside down. Specifically, we propose a ""small data for big
tasks"" paradigm, wherein a single artificial intelligence (AI) system is
challenged to develop ""common sense"", enabling it to solve a wide range of
tasks with little training data. We illustrate the potential power of this new
paradigm by reviewing models of common sense that synthesize recent
breakthroughs in both machine and human vision. We identify functionality,
physics, intent, causality, and utility (FPICU) as the five core domains of
cognitive AI with humanlike common sense. When taken as a unified concept,
FPICU is concerned with the questions of ""why"" and ""how"", beyond the dominant
""what"" and ""where"" framework for understanding vision. They are invisible in
terms of pixels but nevertheless drive the creation, maintenance, and
development of visual scenes. We therefore coin them the ""dark matter"" of
vision. Just as our universe cannot be understood by merely studying observable
matter, we argue that vision cannot be understood without studying FPICU. We
demonstrate the power of this perspective to develop cognitive AI systems with
humanlike common sense by showing how to observe and apply FPICU with little
training data to solve a wide range of challenging tasks, including tool use,
planning, utility inference, and social learning. In summary, we argue that the
next generation of AI must embrace ""dark"" humanlike common sense for solving
novel tasks.

deformation should be taken into account in tracking processes. We propose a

  Collision-induced Absorption","  Explaining the evidence for surface liquid water on early Mars has been a
challenge for climate modelers, as the sun was ~30% less luminous during the
late-Noachian. We propose that the additional greenhouse forcing of CO2-H2
collision-induced absorption is capable of bringing the surface temperature
above freezing and can put early Mars into a limit-cycling regime. Limit cycles
occur when insolation is low and CO2 outgassing rates are unable to balance
with the rapid drawdown of CO2 during warm weathering periods. Planets in this
regime will alternate between global glaciation and transient warm climate
phases. This mechanism is capable of explaining the geomorphological evidence
for transient warm periods in the martian record. Previous work has shown that
collision-induced absorption of CO2-H2 was capable of deglaciating early Mars,
but only with high H2 outgassing rates (greater than ~600 Tmol/yr) and at high
surface pressures (between 3 to 4 bars). We used new theoretically derived
collision-induced absorption coefficients for CO2-H2 to reevaluate the climate
limit cycling hypothesis for early Mars. Using the new and stronger absorption
coefficients in our 1-dimensional radiative convective model as well as our
energy balance model, we find that limit cycling can occur with an H2
outgassing rate as low as ~300 Tmol/yr at surface pressures below 3 bars. Our
results agree more closely with paleoparameters for early martian surface
pressure and hydrogen abundance.

images, even from a single image. To this end, we introduce Character Adaptive
Identity Normalization GAN (CainGAN) which uses spatial characteristic features
extracted by an embedder and combined across source images. The identity
information is propagated throughout the network by applying conditional
normalization. After extensive adversarial training, CainGAN receives figures
of faces from a certain individual and produces new ones while preserving the
person's identity. Experimental results show that the quality of generated
images scales with the size of the input set used during inference.
Furthermore, quantitative measurements indicate that CainGAN performs better

of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers
is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated
aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which
is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The
purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or
weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the
study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to
estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive
maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is
not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often
health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are
generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to
the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena.
This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used
to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of
how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which
the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the
Thermal, the Electrical, the Ambient and the Mechanical (TEAM) stresses behave.

with the Tb(III) nuclear spins leads to a multitude of spin reversal paths
leading to seven strong hyperfine driven tunneling steps in the hysteresis

\textbf{104}, 070402 (2010)] we discuss the physical meaning and the reason why
a large amount of entanglement is needed in order to ensure a bosonic composite
behavior. By applying a composite boson ansatz, we found that a Wigner molecule
confined in two dimensional traps presents a bosonic behavior induced by
symmetry. The two-particle Wigner molecule ground state required by the
composite boson ansatz was obtained within the harmonic approximation in the
strong interacting regime. Our approach allows us to address few-particle
states (widely studied within a variety of theoretical and numerical
techniques) as well as a large number of particles (difficult to address due to
computational costs). For a large number of particles, we found strong
fermionic correlations exposed by the suppression of particle fluctuations. For
a small number of particles, we show that the wave function calculated within
the composite boson ansatz captures the Friedel-Wigner transition. The latter
is shown in a regime in which strong correlations due to the Pauli exclusion
principle arise, therefore, we conclude that the coboson ansatz reproduces the
many particle physics of a confined Wigner molecule, even in the presence of
strong deviations of the ideal bosonic behavior due to fermionic correlations.

exchanges, the $s$-channel $N$ exchange, and the interaction current, one needs
to introduce at least two nucleon resonances in the $s$ channel in constructing

the data on spin density matrix elements for $K^*$ meson reported recently by

fitted by a Tsallis distribution when no barriers are introduced. We provide,
for both cases, the formulae for the minimal barrier density to prevent the

  scalar field and matter","  A matter-coupled scalar field model is presented in obtaining a scalar fifth
force when the constraint of the current cosmological constant is satisfied.
The interaction potential energy density between the scalar field and matter
has a symmetry-breaking form with two potential wells. The cosmological
constant is proven to be a value of the scalar-field's self-interaction
potential energy density at the minimum of an effective
matter-density-dependent potential energy density. The effective potential is a
sum of the interaction potential and the self-interaction potential of the
scalar field. The scalar field can stably sit at the minimum and then the
time-dependent cosmological `constant' behaves like a constant. The observed
cosmic acceleration can be accounted for the scalar field. The scalar field is
also extrapolated to account for inflation at the inflationary era of the
Universe. In this era matter fluid is relativistic and then the interaction
potential wells vanish. The unconfined quintessence therefore dominates the
evolution of the Universe. It is concluded that `Planck 2018 results' favour
the closed space of the Universe. The reasons are not only the measured value
of the current Hubble constant, but also the observed feature of a concave
potential in the framework of single-field inflationary models. By invoking a
pseudo-potential in the inflationary era, the concave feature can be attributed
to the pseudo-potential although the self-interaction potential is a convex
function. The pseudo-potential is defined by a sum of the self-interaction
potential and the energy density scale of the curvature of the Universe. It is
that the positive curvature leads to the concave feature of the
pseudo-potential.

experiments reveal that the radiated field is reshaped according to the angular
dispersion of the nanocavity, and that its spectrum manifests two bands with
different polarization corresponding to the p- and s-polarized resonances of
the cavity. The d-MIM cavities are a highly versatile system for polarization
and wavelength division multiplexing applications at the nanoscale, as well as

nanometric light confinement and waveguiding, and their optical properties are
mostly interpreted in terms of surface plasmon polaritons. Although classic
electromagnetic theory accurately describes their behavior, it often lacks
physical insight, letting some fundamental aspects of light interaction with
these structures unexplored. In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical
description of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well. We identify the
square of the imaginary part of the refractive index of the metal as the
optical potential, and find that MIM cavity resonances are suppressed if the
ratio n/\k{appa} exceeds a certain limit, which shows that low n and high
\k{appa} are desired for strong and sharp cavity resonances. Interestingly, the
spectral regions of cavity mode suppression correspond to the interband
transitions of the metals, where the optical processes are intrinsically
non-Hermitian. The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for
photons, and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant
tunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum
matching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this
analysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures, and by
developing a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of
its effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with
low-loss zeros of the effective permittivity.

constitute a highly versatile and very interesting model system to study and
engineer such mode coupling, since they can be realized by lithography-free
fabrication methods with fine control on the optical and geometrical
parameters. The resonant modes of such MIM cavities are epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
resonances, which are appealing for non-linear photophysics and a variety of
applications. Here we study the hybridization of ENZ resonances in MIMIM
nanocavities, obtaining a very large mode splitting reaching 0.477 eV, Q
factors of the order of 40 in the visible spectral range, and fine control on
the resonance wavelength and mode linewidth by tuning the thickness of the
dielectric and metallic layers. A semi-classical approach that analyses the
MIMIM structure as a double quantum well system allows to derive the exact
analytical dispersion relation of the ENZ resonances, achieving perfect
agreement with numerical simulations and experiments. Interestingly, the
asymmetry of the mode splitting in a symmetric MIMIM cavity is not reflected in
the classical model of coupled oscillators, which can be directly related to
quantum mechanical tunneling for the coupling of the two cavities. Interpreting
the cavity resonances as resonant tunneling modes elucidates that can be

Here, we design metasurfaces based on aperiodic arrays of plasmonic Au
nanostructures for tailoring the optical near-field in the visible and

so that radiation damage must be considered as one of the limits to imaging.
Drawing upon earlier work, we describe here a unified approach to estimating
the image contrast (and thus the required exposure and corresponding radiation
dose) in both x-ray and electron microscopy. This approach accounts for factors
such as plural and inelastic scattering, and (in electron microscopy) the use
of energy filters to obtain so-called ""zero loss"" images. As expected, it shows
that electron microscopy offers lower dose for specimens thinner than about 1
micron (such as for studies of macromolecules, viruses, bacteria and
archaebacteria, and thin sectioned material), while x-ray microscopy offers
superior characteristics for imaging thicker specimen such as whole eukaryotic
cells, thick-sectioned tissues, and organs. The required radiation dose scales
strongly as a function of the desired spatial resolution, allowing one to
understand the limits of live and frozen hydrated specimen imaging. Finally, we
consider the factors limiting x-ray microscopy of thicker materials, suggesting
that specimens as thick as a whole mouse brain can be imaged with x-ray

2004.10107v1,2020-04-21,2020-04-21,On uniqueness of transfer rates in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,"  In hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, expressions for the
transfer rates rely on integrals over wavenumber triads $(\textbf{k,p,q})$
satisfying $\textbf{k+p+q=0}$. As an example $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$ denotes
the kinetic energy transfer rate to the mode $\textbf{k}$, from the two other
modes in the triad, $\textbf{p}$ and $\textbf{q}$. As noted by Kraichnan
(1958), in $S_E^{uu}(\textbf{k|p,q})$, what fraction of the energy transferred
to the mode $\textbf{k}$ originated from $\textbf{p}$ and which from
$\textbf{q}$ is unknown . Such an expression is thus incongruent with the
customary description of turbulence in terms of two-scale energy exchange.
Notwithstanding this issue, Dar etal. (2001) further decomposed these transfers
into separate contributions from $\textbf{p}$-to-$\textbf{k}$ and
$\textbf{q}$-to-$\textbf{k}$, thus introducing the concept of mode-to-mode
transfers that they applied to MHD turbulence. Doing so, they had to set aside
additional transfers circulating within each triad, but failed to calculate
them.
  In the present paper we explain how to derive the complete expressions of the
mode-to-mode transfers, including the circulating transfers. We do it for
kinetic energy and kinetic helicity in hydrodynamic turbulence, for kinetic
energy, magnetic energy and magnetic helicity in MHD turbulence. Separating the
contribution of magnetic advection from magnetic stretching, the energy
mode-to-mode transfer rates involving the magnetic field become uniquely
defined, in striking contrast to the hydrodynamic case. The magnetic helicity
mode-to-mode transfer rate is also found to be uniquely defined, contrary to
kinetic helicity in hydrodynamics. We find that shell-to-shell transfer rates
have the same properties as mode-to-mode transfer rates. Finally calculating
the fluxes, we show how the circulating transfers cancel in accordance with
conservation laws.

2004.10214v1,2020-04-21,2020-04-21,Size distribution of superbubbles,"  We consider the size distribution of superbubbles in a star forming galaxy.
Previous studies have tried to explain the distribution by using adiabatic
self-similar evolution of wind driven bubbles, assuming that bubbles stall when
pressure equilibrium is reached. We show, with the help of hydrodynamical
numerical simulations, that this assumption is not valid. We also include
radiative cooling of shells. In order to take into account non-thermal pressure
in the ambient medium, we assume an equivalent higher temperature than implied
by thermal pressure alone. Assuming that bubbles stall when the outer shock
speed becomes comparable to the ambient sound speed (which includes non-thermal
components), we recover the size distribution with a slope of $\sim -2.7$ for
typical values of ISM pressure in Milky Way, which is consistent with
observations. Our simulations also allow us to follow the evolution of size
distribution in the case of different values of non-thermal pressure, and we
show that the size distribution steepens with lower pressure, to slopes
intermediate between only-growing and only-stalled cases.

  Background toward Clusters of Galaxies","  We show that Compton scattering by electrons of the hot intergalactic gas in
galaxy clusters should lead to peculiar distortions of the cosmic background
X-ray and soft gamma-ray radiation - an increase in its brightness at E<60-100
keV and a drop at higher energies. The distortions allow the most important
cluster parameters to be measured. The spectral shape of the distortions and
its dependence on the gas temperature, optical depth, and surface density
distribution law have been studied using Monte Carlo computations and confirmed
by analytical estimations. In the cluster frame the maximum of the background
decrease due to the recoil effect occurs at ~500-600 keV. The photoionization
of H- and He-like iron and nickel ions leads to additional distortions in the
background spectrum - a strong absorption line with the threshold at ~9 keV
(and also to an absorption jump at ~2 keV for cold clusters). The absorption of
intrinsic thermal radiation from the cluster gas by these ions also leads to
such lines. In nearby (z<1) clusters the line at ~2 keV is noticeably enhanced
by absorption in the colder (~10^6 K) plasma of their peripheral (~3 Mpc)
regions; moreover, the absorption line at ~1.3 keV splits off from it. The
redshift of distant clusters shifts the absorption lines in the background
spectrum (at ~2, ~9, and ~500 keV) to lower energies. Thus, in contrast to the
microwave background scattering effect, this effect depends on the cluster
redshift z, but in a very peculiar way. When observing clusters at z>1, the
effect allows one to determine how the X-ray background evolved and how it was
""gathered"" with z. To detect the effect, the accuracy of measurements should
reach ~0.1%. We consider the most promising clusters for observing the effect
and discuss the techniques whereby the influence of the thermal gas radiation
hindering the detection of background distortions should be minimal.

from MXene to the attached surface layer is still unknown. In this paper, with
comprehensive ultrafast studies, we reported the energy migration pathway from
MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to local environment under plasmonic excitation. Our data found
that in water, energy dissipation is divided into fast hydrogen bond mediated
channel and slow lattice motion mediated channel.The experimental results
suggest that in water, nearly 80% energy in MXene that gained from the
photoexcitation quickly dissipates into surrounding water molecules within 7 ps
as a hydrogen bond mediated fast channel, and the remaining energy vanishes
with time constant ~100 ps as a lattice motion mediated slow channel. The fast
energy migration would result in the prominent interfacial energy conductance
150-300 MW *m{-2}* K{-1} for MXene-water interface. Tuning the solvent into
ethanol could both narrow the energy dissipation to 35% through the fast
channel and slow down the thermal channel (400 ps). To gain the molecular
insight, molecular dynamic results presented different solvents had
significantly different H bond forming ability on MXene surface. Our results
suggested that interfacial interaction is crucial for effective hydrogen bonds
on MXene surface to channel the excitation dissipation, providing important
insights into the photothermal applications with MXene.

runup at shores. This phenomenon has claimed lives and caused damage to
near-shore properties. Landslide tsunamis in lakes are different from typical
earthquake tsunamis in the open ocean in that (i) the affected areas are
usually within the near-field of the source, (ii) the highest runup occurs
within the time period of the geophysical event, and (iii) the enclosed
geometry of a lake does not let the tsunami energy escape. To address the
problem of transient landslide tsunami runup and to predict the resulting
inundation, we utilize a nonlinear model equation in the Lagrangian frame of
reference. The motivation for using such a scheme lies in the fact that the
runup on an inclined boundary is directly and readily computed in the
Lagrangian framework without the need to resort to approximations. In this
work, we investigate the inundation patterns due to landslide tsunamis in a
lake. We show by numerical computations that Airy's approximation of an
irrotational theory using Lagrangian coordinates can legitimately predict runup
of large amplitude. We also demonstrate that in a lake of finite size the
highest runup may be magnified by constructive interference between edge-waves
that are trapped along the shore and multiple reflections of outgoing waves
from opposite shores, and may occur somewhat later after the first inundation.

orbits that simulates their evolution back in time to the epoch when planet
formation ended 4.5 billion years in the past. The simulation is a precise
orbit determination method that does not involve ad hoc initial conditions or
assumptions such as those found in planetesimal disk relaxation models upon
which their conclusions depend. It can therefore be used to independently test
origin theories based on relaxation models by examining the past orbits of
specific real objects. Here, we examined 17 multiple-opposition
high-inclination Centaurs and the two polar trans-neptunian objects 2008 KV42

were nearly polar 4.5 Gyr in the past, and were located in the scattered disk
and inner Oort cloud regions. Early polar inclinations cannot be accounted for
by current Solar system formation theory as the early planetesimal system must
have been nearly flat in order to explain the low-inclination asteroid and
Kuiper belts. Furthermore, the early scattered disk and inner Oort cloud
regions are believed to have been devoid of Solar system material as the
planetesimal disk could not have extended far beyond Neptune's current orbit in
order to halt the planet's outward migration. The nearly polar orbits of
high-inclination Centaurs 4.5 Gyr in the past therefore indicate their probable
early capture from the interstellar medium.

quadrature excess noise which limits applicability of continuous-variable
quantum communication. Such fluctuations are commonly caused by beam wandering
around the receiving aperture. We study the possibility to stabilize the
fluctuations by expanding the beam, and test this channel stabilization in
regard of continuous-variable entanglement sharing and quantum key
distribution. We perform transmittance measurements of a real free-space
atmospheric channel for different beam widths and show that the beam expansion
reduces the fluctuations of the channel transmittance by the cost of an

to maximize the secret key rate or the amount of shared entanglement. Being
autonomous and not requiring adaptive control of the source and detectors based
on characterization of beam wandering, the method of beam expansion can be also

medical image segmentation. Secondly, we present different deep learning
network architectures, then analyze their fusion strategies and compare their
results. The earlier fusion is commonly used, since it's simple and it focuses
on the subsequent segmentation network architecture. However, the later fusion
gives more attention on fusion strategy to learn the complex relationship
between different modalities. In general, compared to the earlier fusion, the
later fusion can give more accurate result if the fusion method is effective
enough. We also discuss some common problems in medical image segmentation.

processing in hydrogen prior to nanotube nucleation and its effect on the
growth morphologies of partially filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synthesized
using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) of propane was
investigated. Results show that pre-heating of the catalyst film deeply
influences the particle size distribution, which governs the growth
morphologies of the corresponding CNTs. The distribution of the catalyst
particles over the Si substrate was analyzed before and after the heat
treatment by atomic force microscopy (AFM) which reveals that heat treatment
causes clusters of catalyst to coalesce and form macroscopic islands. The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the grown material indicates that they are
graphitic in nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis suggested that
the growth density strongly depends on the pre heat treatment of the Fe
catalyst film. Multiwalled CNTs with partial catalyst filling were observed via
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements. The
degree of graphitization of the CNTs also depends on the pre heating as
demonstrated by Raman analysis. A simple model for the growth of partially
catalyst filled nanotubes is proposed.

  radiation exposure associated with solar proton events for the airline
  industry","  We present a systematic approach to effectively evaluate potential risk cost
caused by exposure to solar proton events (SPEs) from solar flares for the
airline industry. We also evaluate associated health risks from radiation, to
provide relevant alternative ways to minimize economic loss and opportunity.
The estimated radiation dose induced by each SPE for the passengers of each
flight is calculated using ExoKyoto and PHITS. We determine a few scenarios for
the estimated dose limit at 1 and 20mSv, corresponding to the effective dose
limit for the general public and occupational exposure, respectively, as well
as a higher dose induced an extreme superflare. We set a hypothetical airline
shutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal
restrictions under the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we
calculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity cost under the
cancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under
such a scenario, if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to
9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to 365g/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes
much smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated total dose goes down
from 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general
public. In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth
484g/cm$^{2}$), the estimated total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we
assume the increase of fuel cost is proportional to the increase in atmospheric
depth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying at 9.5
km and at 7 km, respectively. Lower altitude flights provide more safety for
the potential risk of radiation doses induced by severe SPEs. At the same time,
since there is total loss caused by flight cancelation, we propose that
considering lower flight altitude is the best protection against solar flares.

scientific and technological implications. The uniaxial anisotropy universally
exhibited by two-dimensional magnets has only two stable spin directions,
demanding 180 degrees spin switching between states. We demonstrate a novel
eightfold anisotropy in magnetic SrRuO3 monolayers by inducing a spin
reorientation in (SrRuO3)1/(SrTiO3)N superlattices, in which the magnetic easy
axis of Ru spins is transformed from uniaxial <001> direction (N = 1 and 2) to
eightfold <111> directions (N = 3, 4 and 5). This eightfold anisotropy enables
71 and 109 degrees spin switching in SrRuO3 monolayers, analogous to 71 and 109
degrees polarization switching in ferroelectric BiFeO3. First-principle
calculations reveal that increasing the SrTiO3 layer thickness induces an
emergent correlation-driven orbital ordering, tuning spin-orbit interactions
and reorienting the SrRuO3 monolayer easy axis. Our work demonstrates that
correlation effects can be exploited to substantially change spin-orbit
interactions, stabilizing unprecedented properties in two-dimensional magnets
and opening rich opportunities for low-power, multi-state device applications.

  Field-Effect Transistors","  To explore the potential of field-effect transistors (FETs) based on
monolayers of the two-dimensional semiconducting channel(SC) for spintronics,
the two most important issues are to ensure the formation of variable low
resistive tunnel ferromagnetic contacts(FC), and to preserve intrinsic
properties of the SC during fabrication. Large Schottky barriers lead to the
formation of high resistive contacts and methods adopted to control the
barriers often alter the intrinsic properties of the SC. This work aims at
addressing both issues in fully encapsulated monolayer WSe$_2$ FETs by using
bi-layer h-BN as a tunnel barrier at the FC/SC interface. We investigate the
electrical transport in monolayer WSe$_2$ FETs with current-in-plane geometry
that yields hole mobilities $\sim$ 38.3 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$ at 240 K and
On/Off ratios of the order of 10$^7$, limited by the contact regions. We have
achieved ultralow effective Schottky barrier ($\sim$ 5.34 meV) with
encapsulated tunneling device as opposed to a non-encapsulated device in which
the barrier heights are considerably higher. These observations provide an
insight into the electrical behavior of the FC/h-BN/SC/h-BN heterostructures
and such control over the barrier heights opens up the possibilities for
WSe$_2$-based spintronic devices.

astronomical observations. Here we are investigating the origin of small scale
anomalies, like that of the annually observed temperature anomalies in the
stratosphere. Unexpectedly, we observe a planetary relationship of the daily
stratospheric temperature distribution. Its spectral shape does not match
concurrent solar activity, or solar EUV emission, whose impact on the
atmosphere is unequivocal. This behavior points at an additional energy source
of exosolar origin. A viable concept behind such observations is based on
possible gravitational focusing by the solar system towards the Earth of low
speed invisible matter. We denote generic constituents from the dark Universe
as invisible matter, in order to distinguish them from ordinary dark matter
candidates like axions or WIMPs, which cannot have any noticeable impact on the
stratosphere. The observed peaking planetary relations exclude on their own any
conventional explanation. Only a somehow strongly interacting invisible
streaming matter with the little screened upper stratosphere (noverhead about 1
gr/cm 2) can be behind the occasionally observed temperature increases. We also
estimate an associated energy deposition O(W/m 2), which is variable over the
11 years solar cycle. For the widely assumed picture of a quasi not interacting
dark Universe, this new exosolar energy is enormous. Since the atmosphere is
uninterruptedly monitored since decades, it can serve also parasitically as a
novel low threshold detector for the dark Universe, with built-in
spatiotemporal resolution and the solar system acting temporally as signal
amplifier. In future, analyzing more observations, for example, from the
anomalous ionosphere, or, the transient sudden stratospheric warmings, the
nature of the assumed invisible streams could be deciphered.

the flow, in agreement with the former Karlsruhe experimental results. The
dynamo mechanism is governed by a generalized $\alpha$-effect which includes
both usual $\alpha$-effect and turbulent diffusion, plus all higher order
effects. Beyond the onset we find that this generalized $\alpha$-effect scales
as $O(Rm^{-1})$ suggesting the take-over of small-scale dynamo action. This is
confirmed by simulations in which dynamo occurs even if the large-scale field
is artificially suppressed.

  Memory Encryption with Minimal Assumptions","  One reason for not adopting cloud services is the required trust in the cloud
provider: As they control the hypervisor, any data processed in the system is
accessible to them. Full memory encryption for Virtual Machines (VM) protects
against curious cloud providers as well as otherwise compromised hypervisors.
AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is the most prevalent hardware-based
full memory encryption for VMs. Its newest extension, SEV-ES, also protects the
entire VM state during context switches, aiming to ensure that the host neither
learns anything about the data that is processed inside the VM, nor is able to
modify its execution state. Several previous works have analyzed the security
of SEV and have shown that, by controlling I/O, it is possible to exfiltrate
data or even gain control over the VM's execution. In this work, we introduce
two new methods that allow us to inject arbitrary code into SEV-ES secured
virtual machines. Due to the lack of proper integrity protection, it is
sufficient to reuse existing ciphertext to build a high-speed encryption
oracle. As a result, our attack no longer depends on control over the I/O,
which is needed by prior attacks. As I/O manipulation is highly detectable, our
attacks are stealthier. In addition, we reverse-engineer the previously
unknown, improved Xor-Encrypt-Xor (XEX) based encryption mode, that AMD is
using on updated processors, and show, for the first time, how it can be
overcome by our new attacks.

2004.11221v1,2020-04-23,2020-04-23,Probing the core of the strong nuclear interaction,"  The strong nuclear interaction between nucleons (protons and neutrons) is the
effective force that holds the atomic nucleus together. This force stems from
fundamental interactions between quarks and gluons (the constituents of
nucleons) that are described by the equations of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
However, as these equations cannot be solved directly, physicists resort to
describing nuclear interactions using effective models that are well
constrained at typical inter-nucleon distances in nuclei but not at shorter
distances. This limits our ability to describe high-density nuclear matter such
as in the cores of neutron stars. Here we use high-energy electron scattering
measurements that isolate nucleon pairs in short-distance, high-momentum
configurations thereby accessing a kinematical regime that has not been
previously explored by experiments, corresponding to relative momenta above 400
MeV/c. As the relative momentum between two nucleons increases and their
separation thereby decreases, we observe a transition from a spin-dependent
tensor-force to a predominantly spin-independent scalar-force. These results
demonstrate the power of using such measurements to study the nuclear
interaction at short-distances and also support the use of point-like nucleons
with two- and three-body effective interactions to describe nuclear systems up

detections at separated locations. These correlations are exploited in
entangled-state quantum key distribution. To do so involves setting up and
maintaining a rhythm of communication among clocks at separated locations.
Here, we try to disentangle our thinking about clocks as used in actual
experiments from theories of time, such as special relativity or general
relativity, which already differ between each other. Special relativity
intertwines the concept of time with a particular definition of the
synchronization of clocks, which precludes synchronizing every clock to every
other clock. General relativity imposes additional barriers to synchronization,
barriers that invite seeking an alternative depending on any global concept of
time. To this end, we focus on how clocks are actually used in some
experimental situations. We show how working with clocks without worrying about
time makes it possible to generalize some designs for quantum key distribution
and also clarifies the need for alternatives to the special-relativistic
definition of synchronization.

magnetoreceptors. The classic example is a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene
(C+PF-) radical pair that has been shown to provide a ""proof-of-principle"" for
the operation of a chemical compass [K. Maeda et al., Nature 453, 387 (2008)].
Previous simulations of this radical pair have employed semiclassical
approximations, which are routinely applicable to its 47 coupled electronic and
nuclear spins. However, calculating the exact quantum mechanical spin dynamics
presents a significant challenge, and has not been possible before now. Here we
use a recently developed method to perform numerically converged simulations of
the C+PF- quantum mechanical spin dynamics, including all coupled spins.
Comparison of these quantum mechanical simulations with various semiclassical
approximations reveals that, while it is not perfect, the best semiclassical
approximation does capture essentially all of the relevant physics in this
problem.

numerical simulations of motility transfer in two typical cases, namely for
interacting particles with weak inertia effect, by analyzing their velocity
distributions, and for interacting overdamped particles, by studying their

enhancement of the host species of up to a factor of four. This technique of

properties of magnetic materials and devices. In this study, we report that the

of the Bloch walls. When the specimen was tilted, the magnetic deflection
effect, as well as the periodic spots of magnetic domains, occurred. Thus, we
were able to visualize the magnetic domains with different magnetization

mixture of non-Brownian particles and two immiscible liquids. The suspension of
particles in a liquid undergoes gelation upon the addition of a small content
of second, wetting liquid which forms liquid bridges between particles leading
to a sample spanning network. The rheology of this gel primarily exhibits a
yield stress at low shear rates followed by a linear variation of shear stress
at high shear rates. The apparent yield stress extracted from the flow curves
increases rapidly with volume fraction of second liquid before saturation,
while it exhibits a monotonic increase with increasing particle concentration.
Rescaling of the yield stress curves using suitable shift factors results in an
empirical expression for the yield stress showing squared dependence on liquid
fraction and a rapid increase with particle fraction above a certain value,
both combined in a highly nonlinear manner. The microstructural variations with
changing secondary liquid content and particle fractions are captured using
three dimensional X-ray tomography technique. The microstructure is observed to
show increased local compactness with increased liquid content and increased
spatial homogeneity with increased particle fractions. The images from X-ray
tomography are analysed to obtain the distributions of particle-particle bonds
(coordination number) in the system which serve to explain the observed yield
stress behavior in a qualitative manner.

The Huang-Rhys parameter is evaluated by the intensity ratio of the
longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon of CdS with its first multiscattering (2LO)

onset of the CdS shell absorption to well above the CdS shell band edge to get
insight into resonance effects of the CdS LO phonon with high energy excitonic
transitions. The isotropic spherical giant-shell nanocrystals show consistently
stronger exciton-phonon coupling as compared to the anisotropic rod-shaped
dot-in-rod (DiR) architecture, and the 2LO/LO intensity ratio decreases for
excitation wavelengths approaching the CdS band edge. The strong exciton-phonon
coupling in the spherical giant-shell nanocrystals can be related to the
delocalization of the electronic wave functions. Furthermore, we observe the

  Al$_2$O$_3$ Composite Films fabricated by Atomic Layer Deposition","  Colloidal nanocrystals are a promising fluorescent class of materials, whose
spontaneous emission features can be tuned over a broad spectral range via
their composition, geometry and size. However, towards embedding nanocrystals
films in elaborated device geometries, one significant drawback is the
sensitivity of their emission properties on further fabrication processes like
lithography, metal or oxide deposition, etc. In this work, we demonstrate how
bright emitting and robust thin films can be obtained by combining nanocrystal
deposition from solutions via spin2 coating with subsequent atomic layer
deposition of alumina. For the resulting composite films, the layer thickness
can be controlled on the nanoscale, and their refractive index can be finely
tuned by the amount of deposited alumina. Ellipsometry is used to measure the
real and imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity, which gives direct
access to the wavelength dependent refractive index absorbance of the film.
Detailed analysis of the photophysics of thin films of core-shell nanocrystal
with different shape and different shell thickness allow to correlate the
behavior of the photoluminescence and of the decay life time to the changes in
the non-radiative rate that are induced by the alumina deposition. We show that
the photoemission properties of such composite films are stable in wavelength
and intensity over several months, and that the photoluminescence completely
recovers from heating processes up to 240$^\circ$C. The latter is particularly
interesting, since it demonstrates robustness to the typical heat treatment
that is needed in several process steps like resist-based lithography and
deposition by thermal or electron beam evaporation of metals or oxides.

the performance of NCs based optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic cells,
photodetectors and light emitting diodes (LEDs). On one hand, the NC emission
depends critically on the passivation of the surface to minimize trap states
that can provide non-radiative recombination channels. On the other hand, the
electrical properties of NC films are dominated by the ligands that constitute
the barriers for charge transport from one NC to its neighbor. Therefore,
surface modifications via ligandexchange have been employed to improve the
conductance of NC films. However, in light emitting devices, such surface
modifications are more critical due to their possible detrimental effects on
the emission properties. In this work, we study the role of surface ligand
modifications on the optical and electrical properties of CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods
(DiRs) in films, and investigate their performance in all-solution processed
LEDs. The DiR films maintain high PLQY, around 40-50%, and their
electroluminescence in the LED preserves the excellent color purity of the PL.
In the LEDs, the ligand-exchange boosted the luminance, reaching a four-fold
increase from 2200 cd/m2 for native surfactants to 8500 cd/m2 for the exchanged
aminoethanethiol ligands. Moreover, the efficiency roll-off, operational
stability, and shelf life are significantly improved, and the external quantum
efficiency is modestly increased from 5.1 % to 5.4 %. We relate these
improvements to the increased conductivity of the emissive layer, and to the
better charge balance of the electrically injected carriers. In this respect,
we performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to obtain deeper
insight in the band alignment of the LED structure.

heavy-ion collisions at the international Facility for Antiproton and Ion
Research (FAIR), which is under construction in Darmstadt, Germany. The CBM
research program is focused on the exploration of QCD matter at neutron star
core densities, such as study of the equation-of-state and the search for phase
transitions. Key experimental observables include (multi-) strange (anti-)
particles, electron-positron pairs and dimuons, particle correlations and
fluctuations, and hyper-nuclei. In order to measure these diagnostic probes
multi-differentially with unprecedented precision, the CBM detector and data
acquisition systems are designed to run at reaction rates up to 10 MHz. This
requires the development of fast and radiation hard detectors and readout
electronics for track reconstruction, electron and muon identification,
time-of-flight determination, and event characterization. The data are read-out
by ultra-fast, radiation-tolerant, and free-streaming front-end electronics,
and then transferred via radiation-hard data aggregation units and high-speed
optical connections to a high-performance computing center. A fast and highly
parallelized software will perform online track reconstruction, particle
identification, and event analysis. The components of the CBM experimental
setup will be discussed, and results of physics performance studies will be
presented.

themselves composed of quarks and gluons. Understanding how the quark-gluon
structure of a nucleon bound in an atomic nucleus is modified by the
surrounding nucleons is an outstanding challenge. Although evidence for such
modification, known as the EMC effect, was first observed over 35 years ago,
there is still no generally accepted explanation of its cause. Recent
observations suggest that the EMC effect is related to close-proximity Short
Range Correlated (SRC) nucleon pairs in nuclei. Here we report the first
simultaneous, high-precision, measurements of the EMC effect and SRC
abundances. We show that the EMC data can be explained by a universal
modification of the structure of nucleons in neutron-proton (np) SRC pairs and
present the first data-driven extraction of this universal modification
function. This implies that, in heavier nuclei with many more neutrons than
protons, each proton is more likely than each neutron to belong to an SRC pair
and hence to have its quark structure distorted.

  Question Answering and Spatial Semantic Lifting","  Learning knowledge graph (KG) embeddings is an emerging technique for a
variety of downstream tasks such as summarization, link prediction, information
retrieval, and question answering. However, most existing KG embedding models
neglect space and, therefore, do not perform well when applied to (geo)spatial
data and tasks. For those models that consider space, most of them primarily
rely on some notions of distance. These models suffer from higher computational
complexity during training while still losing information beyond the relative
distance between entities. In this work, we propose a location-aware KG
embedding model called SE-KGE. It directly encodes spatial information such as
point coordinates or bounding boxes of geographic entities into the KG
embedding space. The resulting model is capable of handling different types of
spatial reasoning. We also construct a geographic knowledge graph as well as a
set of geographic query-answer pairs called DBGeo to evaluate the performance
of SE-KGE in comparison to multiple baselines. Evaluation results show that
SE-KGE outperforms these baselines on the DBGeo dataset for geographic logic
query answering task. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our
spatially-explicit model and the importance of considering the scale of
different geographic entities. Finally, we introduce a novel downstream task
called spatial semantic lifting which links an arbitrary location in the study
area to entities in the KG via some relations. Evaluation on DBGeo shows that
our model outperforms the baseline by a substantial margin.

  plant organ","  Plant organ outgrowth superficially appears like the continuous mechanical
deformation of a sheet of cells. Yet, how precisely cells as individual
mechanical entities can act to morph a tissue reliably and efficiently into
three dimensions during outgrowth is still puzzling especially when cells are
tightly connected as in plant tissue. In plants, the mechanics of cells within
a tissue is particularly well defined as individual cell growth is essentially
the mechanical yielding of cell-wall in response to internal turgor pressure.
Cell wall stiffness is controlled by biological signalling and, hence, cell
growth is observed to respond to mechanical stresses building up within a
tissue. What is the role of the mechanical feedback during morphing of tissue
in three dimensions? Here, we develop a three dimensional vertex model to
investigate tissue mechanics at the onset of organ outgrowth at the tip of a
plant shoot. We find that organ height is primarily governed by the ratio of
growth rates of faster growing cells initiating the organ to slower growing
cells surrounding them. Remarkably, the outgrowth rate is higher when cells
growth responds to the tissue-wide mechanical stresses. Our quantitative
analysis of simulation data shows that tissue mechanical feedback on cell
growth can act via twofold mechanism. First, the feedback guides patterns of
cellular growth. Second, the feedback modifies the stress patterns on the
cells, consequently amplifying and propagating growth anisotropies. This
mechanism may allow plants to grow organs efficiently out of the meristem by
reorganizing the cellular growth rather than inflating growth rates.

collocation Chebyshev method. In a particular geometry of anisotropy and
wavenumber, we also derive an analytical solution, where the eigenvectors are
just combinations of four exponential functions. An explicit analytical
expression is obtained for the critical magnetic Reynold number. Above the
critical magnetic Reynold number, we have also derived an analytical expression
for the growth rate showing that this is a 'very fast' dynamo, extrapolating on

mushy-zone thickness and the velocity field, the solid-liquid interface
morphology and the rate of phase-change are sensitive to the permeability
coefficient. It is demonstrated that numerical predictions of an isothermal

sufficiently fine meshes. It is also shown that sensitivity to the choice of

function is also derived. The degree of correlation diminishes continuously
with the growth of the number of particles. The ideal finite gas system is
usually correlated, becomes less correlated when the number of particles grows,
and is finally, fully uncorrelated when the molecular chaos regime is reached.
It is also advocated that both approaches can be confronted through a careful

that Tsallis q-statistics may play a physical role more fundamental than

magnetocaloric effect in Mn$_{1+x}$Fe$_{4-x}$Si$_{3}$ ($ x =$ 0 to 1) are
studied in detail. Our measurements show no thermal hysteresis across the
magnetic transition for the parent compound which is in contrast with the
previous report and corroborate the second order nature of the transition. The
magnetic transition could be tuned continuously with Mn substitution at the Fe
site. The Mn substitution leads to a linear increase in the unit cell volume
and a slight reduction in the effective moment. A detailed critical analysis of
the magnetization data for $x = 0.0$ and 0.2 is performed in the critical
regime using the modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fisher plot, universal curve
scaling, and scaling analysis of magnetocaloric effect. The magnetization
isotherms follow modified Arrott plots with critical exponent ($\beta \simeq
0.308$, $\gamma \simeq 1.448$, and $\delta \simeq 5.64$) for the parent
compound ($x=0.0$) and ($\beta \simeq 0.304$, $\gamma \simeq 1.445$, and
$\delta \simeq 5.64$) for $x = 0.2$. The Kouvel-Fisher and universal scaling
plots of the magnetization isotherms further confirm the reliability of our
critical analysis and values of the exponents. These values of the critical
exponents are found to be same for both the parent and doped samples which do
not fall under any of the standard universality classes. A reasonable
magnetocaloric effect $\Delta S_{\rm m}\simeq-6.67$~J/Kg-K and -5.84~J/Kg-K for

propagated through a linear dissipative material which displays hereditary

in the small quantities, namely, the displacement gradient, velocity and
velocity gradient, each harmonic with frequency $\omega$, and so give rise to
attenuated constant terms as well as to inhomogeneous plane waves of frequency
$2\omega$. The quadratic terms are usually removed by time averaging but we
retain them here as they are of comparable magnitude with the time-averaged

viscoelasticity that connects the amplitudes of the terms of the energy

that the complex group velocity is related to the amplitudes of the terms with

is very likely associated with the ordering of the potassium ions. A
semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs signified by the disappearance of the
excitonic features from the electron energy-loss spectra and the emergence of a

plasmon has a positive, quadratic dispersion and appears to be superimposed
with an excitation arising from interband transitions. The behavior of the
plasmon peak energy positions as a function of potassium concentration shows
that potassium stoichiometries of less than $\sim 0.3$ are thermodynamically

trending topic in the domain of ubiquitous computing. It has recently drawn
substantial attention of the smart cities and urban computing communities. In

develop, in this paper, a solution for selecting highly relevant data from an

photo-based MCS framework for event reporting incorporates (i) a deep learning
model to eliminate false submissions and ensure photos credibility and (ii) an
A-Tree shape data structure model for clustering streaming pictures to reduce

indicate that the implemented framework can effectively reduce false

2004.13283v1,2020-04-28,2020-04-28,Various Ways to Quantify BDMPs,"  A Boolean logic driven Markov process (BDMP) is a dependability analysis
model that defines a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). This formalism has
high expressive power, yet it remains readable because its graphical
representation stays close to standard fault trees. The size of a BDMP is
roughly speaking proportional to the size of the system it models, whereas the
size of the CTMC specified by this BDMP suffers from exponential growth. Thus
quantifying large BDMPs can be a challenging task. The most general method to
quantify them is Monte Carlo simulation, but this may be intractable for highly
reliable systems. On the other hand, some subcategories of BDMPs can be
processed with much more efficient methods. For example, BDMPs without repairs
can be translated into dynamic fault trees, a formalism accepted as an input of
the STORM model checker, that performs numerical calculations on sparse
matrices, or they can be processed with the tool FIGSEQ that explores paths
going to a failure state and calculates their probabilities. BDMPs with repairs
can be quantified by FIGSEQ (BDMPs capturing quickly and completely repairable
behaviors are solved by a different algorithm), and by the I&AB (Initiator and
All Barriers) method, recently published and implemented in a prototype version
of RISKSPECTRUM PSA. This tool, based exclusively on Boolean representations
looks for and quantifies minimal cut sets of the system, i.e., minimal
combinations of component failures that induce the loss of the system. This
allows a quick quantification of large models with repairable components,
standby redundancies and some other types of dependencies between omponents.
All these quantification methods have been tried on a benchmark whose
definition was published at the MARS 2017 workshop: the model of emergency
power supplies of a nuclear power plant. In this paper, after a recall of the
theoretical principles of the various quantification methods, we compare their
performances on that benchmark.

protocols have been designed as variations of the seminal Paxos, yet in 2014
Raft was presented as a new, ""understandable"" protocol, meant to be easier to
implement than the notoriously subtle Paxos family. Raft has since been used in
various industrial projects, e.g. Hashicorp's Consul or etcd (used by Google's
Kubernetes). The correctness of Raft is established via a manual proof, based
on a TLA+ specification of the protocol. This paper reports our experience in
modeling Raft in the LNT process algebra. We found a couple of issues with the
original TLA+ specification of Raft, which has been corrected since. More
generally, this exercise offers a great opportunity to discuss how to best use
the features of the LNT formal language and the associated CADP verification
toolbox to model distributed protocols, including network and server failures.

representations based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) often help to tackle
the well-known state-space explosion problem. Symbolic BDD-based
representations have been also shown to be successful for the analysis of
families of systems that arise, e.g., through configurable parameters or
following the feature-oriented modeling approach. The state space of such
system families face an additional exponential blowup in the number of
parameters or features. It is well known that the order of variables in ordered
BDDs is crucial for the size of the model representation. Especially for
automatically generated models from real-world systems, family models might
even be not constructible due to bad variable orders. In this paper we describe
a technique, called iterative variable reordering, that can enable the
construction of large-scale family models. We exemplify feasibility of our
approach by means of an aircraft velocity control system with redundancy
mechanisms modeled in the input language of the probabilistic model checker
PRISM. We show that standard reordering and dynamic reordering techniques fail
to construct the family model due to memory and time constraints, respectively,
while the new iterative approach succeeds to generate a symbolic family model.

2004.13292v1,2020-04-28,2020-04-28,Synthesizing Strategies for Needle Steering in Gelatin Phantoms,"  In medicine, needles are frequently used to deliver treatments to subsurface
targets or to take tissue samples from the inside of an organ. Current clinical
practice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although
that may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its
interaction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled.
(Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a
target is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally
invasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and
needle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often
be computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed
games to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in
tissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which
abstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears
to be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the
model, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise
motion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those
strategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable
behavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to
implement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the
real system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle
tip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target. We
have implemented the model in Uppaal Stratego and evaluated it on steering a
flexible needle in gelatin phantoms; gelatin phantoms are commonly used in
medical technology to simulate the behavior of soft tissue. The experiments
show that strategies can be synthesized for both generated and measured needle
motions with a maximum deviation of 1.84mm.

batteries, these mechanical functions could enable their integration in
emerging technologies such as wearable, free-form electronics and ultimately as
structural elements, for example, in transport applications. This work presents
a method to produce flexible LiFePO4 LFP electrodes with an extraordinary
combination of electrochemical and mechanical performance. Such electrodes
exhibit an exceptionally high specific toughness, combined with superior rate
capability and energy density, with respect to reference electrodes with
typical metallic current collectors. These properties are a result of the
strong adhesion of the active material particles to the high surface area
carbon nanotube fiber fabric, used as a lightweight, tough, and highly
conducting current collector. This strong adherence minimizes electrical
resistance, mitigates interfacial failure, and increases ductility through
heterogeneous strain after cohesive failure of the inorganic phase. As a
result, these electrodes can withstand large deformations before fracture, and,
even after fracture, they retain excellent electrochemical performance,
approximately double that of unstretched, Al-supported LFP electrodes with
equivalent loading.

2004.13352v1,2020-04-28,2020-04-28,A Perspective on High-performance CNT fibres for Structural Composites,"  This review summarizes progress on structural composites with carbon nanotube
fibres. It starts by analyzing their development towards a macroscopic ensemble
of elongated and aligned crystalline domains, alongside the evolution of the
structure of traditional high-performance fibres. Literature on tensile
properties suggests that there are two emerging grades: highly aligned fibres
spun from liquid crystalline solutions, with high modulus and strength, and
spun from aerogels of ultra long-nanotubes, combining high strength and
fracture energy. The fabrication of large unidirectional fabrics with similar
properties as the fibres is presently a challenge, which CNT alignment
remaining a key factor. A promising approach is to produce fabrics directly
from aerogel filaments without having to densify and handle individual CNT
fibres. Structural composites of CNT fibres have reached high longitudinal
properties, however, on relatively small samples. In general, there is need to
demonstrate fabrication of large CNT fibre laminate composites using standard
fabrication routes and to study longitudinal and transverse mechanical
properties in tension and compression. Complementary areas of development are

  Transfer","  Distributed laser charging (DLC) is a wireless power transfer technology for
mobile electronics. Similar to traditional wireless charging systems, the DLC
system can only provide constant power to charge a battery. However, Li-ion
battery needs dynamic input current and voltage, thus power, in order to
optimize battery charging performance. Therefore, neither power transmission
efficiency nor battery charging performance can be optimized by the DLC system.
We at first propose an adaptive DLC (ADLC) system to optimize wireless power
transfer efficiency and battery charging performance. Then, we analyze ADLC's

ADLC's power conversion performance by simulation, which illustrates its
efficiency improvement by saving at least 60.4% of energy, comparing with the

of electronic devices. The power supply problem of IoT devices constitutes a
major challenge in current IoT development, due to the poor battery endurance
as well as the troublesome cable deployment. The wireless power transfer (WPT)
technology has recently emerged as a promising solution. Yet, existing WPT
advances cannot support free and mobile charging like Wi-Fi communications. To
this end, the concept of mobile energy transfer (MET) is proposed, which relies
critically on an resonant beam charging (RBC) technology. The adaptive (A) RBC
technology builds on RBC, but aims at improving the charging efficiency by
charging devices at device preferred current and voltage levels adaptively. A
mobile ARBC scheme is developed relying on an adaptive source power control.
Extensive numerical simulations using a 1,000mAh Li-ion battery show that the
mobile ARBC outperforms simple charging schemes such as the constant power
charging, the profile-adaptive charging, and the distance-adaptive charging in
saving energy.

in the same order of magnitude to a several orders of magnitude difference. In
cases when a gravitational-wave signal is reconstructed without waveform

processes on the surfaces of stars that induce a stochastic signal, or

empirically and carefully measure the RV jitter of more than 600 stars from the
California Planet Search (CPS) sample on a star-by-star basis. As part of this

appendices listing every ostensibly companion-induced signal we removed and
every activity cycle we noted. We then use precise stellar properties from
Brewer et al. (2017) to separate the sample into bins of stellar mass and
examine trends with activity and with evolutionary state. We find RV jitter
tracks stellar evolution and that in general, stars evolve through different
stages of RV jitter: the jitter in younger stars is driven by magnetic
activity, while the jitter in older stars is convectively-driven and dominated
by granulation and oscillations. We identify the ""jitter minimum"" -- where
activity-driven and convectively-driven jitter have similar amplitudes -- for
stars between 0.7 and 1.7 $M_{\odot}$ and find that more massive stars reach
this jitter minimum later in their lifetime, in the subgiant or even giant
phases. Finally, we comment on how these results can inform future radial

Synchrotron emission in the optical on scales up to a few kpc was reported for

regions with upper limit to their linear size of about 100 pc. This is the
first time that such compact components in hotspots have been detected in a
mini-sample, indicating that they are not a peculiar characteristic of a few
individual hotspots. The polarization may reach values up to 70 per cent in
compact (about 0.1 kpc scale) regions within the hotspot, indicating a highly
ordered magnetic field with size up to a hundred parsecs. On larger scales, the
average polarization of the hotspot component is about 30-45 per cent,
suggesting the presence of a significant random field component, rather than an
ordered magnetic field. This is further supported by the displacement between
the peaks in polarized intensity and in total intensity images that is observed
in all the four hotspots. The electric vector position angle is not constant,
but changes arbitrarily in the central part of the hotspot regions, whereas it
is usually perpendicular to the total intensity contours of the outermost edge

  classic case for supernovae remnants","  The thin layer approximation applied to the expansion of a supernova remnant
assumes that all the swept mass resides in a thin shell. The law of motion in
the thin layer approximation is therefore found using the conservation of
momentum. Here we instead introduce the conservation of energy in the framework
of the thin layer approximation. The first case to be analysed is that of an
interstellar medium with constant density and the second case is that of 7
profiles of decreasing density with respect to the centre of the explosion. The
analytical and numerical results are applied to 4 supernova remnants: Tycho,
Cas A, Cygnus loop, and SN 1006. The back reaction due to the radiative losses
for the law of motion is evaluated in the case of constant density of the
interstellar medium.

may help identify biases in future generations of climate models.

YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) with an artificial pinning landscape is
investigated. Columns of point defects are fabricated by two different methods
of ion irradiation -- scanning the focused 30 keV ion beam in a helium ion
microscope or employing the wide-field 75 keV He$^+$ beam of an ion implanter
through a stencil mask. Simulations of the ion-target interactions and the
resulting collision cascades reveal that with both methods square arrays of
defect columns with sub-$\mu$m spacings can be created. They consist of dense
point-defect clusters, which act as pinning centers for Abrikosov vortices.
This is verified by the measurement of commensurable peaks of the critical
current and related minima of the flux-flow resistance vs magnetic field at the
matching fields. In oblique magnetic fields the matching features are
exclusively governed by the component of the magnetic field parallel to the
axes of the columnar defects, which confirms that the magnetic flux is
penetrated along the defect columns. We demonstrate that the latter dominate
the pinning landscape despite of the strong intrinsic pinning in thin YBCO
films.

an adaptive multi-photon subtraction scheme where a particular subtraction task

subtraction. We also experimentally demonstrate the core building block of the

subtraction blocks where the splitting ratio of the second subtraction beam
splitter is affected by the measurement result from the first subtraction block

including highly nonclassical Fock states and squeezed light, advancing the

need to engage with both elements in the view (e.g., nodes, links) and

and complexity of a network grow, interactive displays supporting multimodal
input (e.g., touch, speech, pen, gaze) exhibit the potential to facilitate
fluid interaction during visual network exploration and analysis. While
multimodal interaction with network visualization seems like a promising idea,
many open questions remain. For instance, do users actually prefer multimodal
input over unimodal input, and if so, why? Does it enable them to interact more
naturally, or does having multiple modes of input confuse users? To answer such
questions, we conducted a qualitative user study in the context of a network
visualization tool, comparing speech- and touch-based unimodal interfaces to a
multimodal interface combining the two. Our results confirm that participants
strongly prefer multimodal input over unimodal input attributing their
preference to: 1) the freedom of expression, 2) the complementary nature of
speech and touch, and 3) integrated interactions afforded by the combination of
the two modalities. We also describe the interaction patterns participants
employed to perform common network visualization operations and highlight
themes for future multimodal network visualization systems to consider.

  on dMe Stars. I. Discussion of Gas Dynamic Models","  In connection with a published critique, the author justifies the use of a
motionless homogeneous plane layer of pure hydrogen plasma that is near local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for analyzing the characteristics of the
radiation from a chromospheric condensation of thickness $\Delta{}z_m=10\text{
km}$ in a gas dynamic model of stellar flares. It is shown that the shock-wave
model of flares proposed by Belova and Bychkov, as opposed to the model of
Kostyuk and Pikelner, has irremovable internal defects owing to exclusion of
the interaction between a thermal wave (temperature jump) and a non-stationary
radiative shock. In particular, this model (a) does not make it possible to
increase the geometric thickness of a chromospheric condensation owing to
divergence of the fronts of the thermal and shock waves during impulsive
heating, (b) cannot provide heating of the chromospheres of red dwarfs over
significant distances, and (c) predicts $\mathrm{H}_\alpha$ line profiles in
conflict with observational data. It is argued that: (a) the shock-wave model
by Belova and Bychkov represents a development of the kinematic model of solar
flares (Nakagawa et al.) and its application to dMe stars, specifically: a
study of the radiative response of the chromosphere of a red dwarf to impulsive
heating in the simplest gas dynamic statement of the problem (a thermal wave is
excluded, a stationary approach is used); (b) in terms of the Kostyuk and
Pikelner model, the regions behind the stationary shock fronts do not
correspond to a chromospheric condensation with time-varying thickness but to
zones in which the plasma relaxes to a state of thermal equilibrium. It is
emphasized that the separation of the Kostyuk and Pikelner model into ""thermal""
and ""shock-wave"" components is fundamentally impossible.

  crystal slabs","  Bound states in the continuum (BICs), circularly polarized states (C points)
and degenerate states are all of three types of singular points of polarization
in the momentum space. For photonic crystal slabs (PhCSs) with linearly
polarized far fields, BICs were found to be the centers of polarization
vortices and attracted more attention in the previous studies. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate that the far fields of PhCSs can exhibit remarkably
diverse polarizations due to the robust existences of C points in the
continuum. Only a pair of C points with identical handedness and opposite
topological charge can be annihilated together. Continuously fine tuning of the
structure parameters of PhCSs without breaking their symmetry, a pair of C
points with identical topological charge and opposite handedness are able to
merge into a BIC, then the BIC splits into C points again. Interestingly, a
Dirac-degenerate BIC with one half of topological charge is observed when two
pairs of C points with identical topological charge from the upper and lower
band, respectively, simultaneously merge at the Dirac-degenerate point. The law
of topological charge conservation is verified to play an important role in the
evolutions and interconversions between different types of polarization
singularities. Our findings might shed light on the origin of singular points
of polarization, could open a gateway towards the applications of them in the
generation and manipulation of vector beams.

Josephson junctions with Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (RDSOI) in
the presence of a Zeeman field. Through investigating self-biased supercurrent
(so called $\varphi_0$-Josephson state), we obtain explicit expressions for the
functionality of the $\varphi_0$ state with respect to RDSOI parameters
($\alpha,\beta$) and in-plane Zeeman field components ($h_x,h_y$). Our findings
reveal that, when the chemical potential ($\mu$) is high enough compared to the
energy gap ($\Delta$) in superconducting electrodes, i.e., $\mu \gg \Delta$,
RSOI and DSOI with equal strengths ($|\alpha|=|\beta|$) cause vanishing
$\varphi_0$ state independent of magnetization and the type of RDSOI. A Zeeman
field with unequal components, i.e., $|h_x|\neq |h_y|$, however, can counteract
and nullify the destructive impact of equal-strength RDSOIs (for one type
only), where $\mu\sim\Delta$, although $|h_x|= |h_y|$ can still eliminate the
$\varphi_0$ state. Remarkably, in the $\mu\sim\Delta$ limit, the $\varphi_0$
state is proportional to the multiplication of both components of an in-plane
Zeeman field, i.e., $h_xh_y$, which is absent in the $\mu \gg \Delta$ limit.
Furthermore, our results of critical supercurrents demonstrate that the
persistent spin helices can be revealed in a high enough chemical potential
regime $\mu\gg \Delta$, while an opposite regime, i.e., $\mu\sim\Delta$,
introduces an adverse effect. In the ballistic regime, the ""maximum"" of the
critical supercurrent occurs at $|\alpha|=|\beta|$ and the Zeeman field can
boost this feature. The presence of disorder and nonmagnetic impurities change
this picture drastically so the ""minimum"" of the critical supercurrent occurs
at and around the symmetry lines $|\alpha|=|\beta|$.

The nanostructures, with large surface-to-volume ratio and easy field-effect

expressed properly using the decimation transformation process in the presence
of an external field so that their applications lead to some significant
physical results. Indeed, their applications produce or reproduce some relevant
and important results which were included in cumbersome mathematics in the
previous studies, if not in a form impossible to understand. The average
magnetization or the order parameter $<\!\!\sigma\!\!> $ is expressed as
$<\!\!\sigma_{0,i}\!\!>=
  <\!\!\tanh[ \kappa(\sigma_{1,i}+\sigma_{2,i}+\dots +\sigma_{z,i})+H]\!\!> $.
Here, $\kappa$ is the coupling strength, $z$ is the number of nearest
neighbors. $\sigma_{0,i}$ denotes the central spin at the $i^{th}$ site, while
$\sigma_{l,i}$, $l=1,2,\dots,z$ are the nearest neighbor spins around the
central spin. $H$ is the normalized external magnetic field. We show that the
application of this relation to the 1D Ising model reproduces readily the
previously obtained exact results in the absence of an external field.
Furthermore, the three-site correlation functions of square and honeycomb
lattices of the form $<\!\!\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sigma_{3}\!\!>$ are
analytically obtained. One finds that the three-site correlation functions are
equal to $f(\kappa)\!\!<\!\!\sigma\!\!>$. Here $f(\kappa)$ depends on the
lattice types and is an analytic function of coupling constant. This result
indicates that the critical properties of three-site correlation functions of
those lattices are the same as the corresponding order parameters
$<\!\!\sigma\!\!>$ of those lattices. This will mean that the uniqueness of the
average magnetization as an order parameter is questionable. ...

studied. The competition between the organisms is taken into account through
the assumption that the reproduction and/or death probability of an individual
is influenced by the number of other individuals within a neighborhood with
radius R. It is observed that for a wide range of parameters the competition
advantage is given to the individuals whose motion is characterized by
intermediate values of diffusion coefficient, instead of the most or least
motile ones. The optimal level of the dispersal is determined by the interplay
between various factors such as cluster formation, temporal fluctuations,
initial conditions, and carrying capacity of the system. The dynamics and the

mechanism and process of the natural selection in such dispersal-structured
populations. Furthermore, the rescaling of the results is discussed for

  Thermodynamics for Mini-Super-Space, Semi-Classical Polymeric BH","  This work discusses observational evidences of quantum effects on geometry in
a black hole (BH) astrophysical context. We study properties of a family of
loop quantum corrected regular BH solutions and their horizons, focusing on the
geometry symmetries. We explore a recent model where the geometry is determined
by a metric quantum modification outside the horizon: a regular static
spherical solution of minisuperspace BH metric with Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
corrections. The solutions are characterized by some polymeric functions and
the emergence of a singularity in the limiting Schwarzschild geometry. We
discuss particular metric solutions for similar properties of structures, the
metric Killing bundles (metric bundles MBs), related to the BH horizons
properties. A comparison with the Reissner-Nordstrom geometry and the Kerr
geometry, similar for their respective MBs properties is done. The analysis
provides a way to recognize these geometries and detect phenomenological
evidence of LQG origin by the detection of stationary/static observers and the
properties of lightlike orbits with the analysis of the conformal invariant MBs
related to the (local) causal structure. This approach could be applied in
other quantum corrected BH solutions constraining the characteristics of the
underlining LQG-graph, as the minimal loop area, through photons detection.
Light surfaces associated with a diversified range of BH phenomenology and
grounding MB definition provide a research channel of possible astrophysical
evidence. The BHs thermodynamic characteristics are studied, luminosity,
surface gravity, and temperature. Ultimately the application of this method to
this spherically symmetric approximate solution provides a way to clarify some
formal aspects of MBs in the presence of static spherical symmetric spacetimes.

2005.01489v1,2020-04-30,2020-04-30,"Towards Extremely Precise Radial Velocities: I. Simulated Solar Spectra
  for Testing Exoplanet Detection Algorithms","  Recent and upcoming stabilized spectrographs are pushing the frontier for
Doppler spectroscopy to detect and characterize low-mass planets.
Specifications for these instruments are so impressive that intrinsic stellar
variability is expected to limit their Doppler precision for most target stars
(Fischer et al. 2016). To realize their full potential, astronomers must
develop new strategies for distinguishing true Doppler shifts from intrinsic
stellar variability. Stellar variability due to star spots, faculae and other
rotationally-linked variability are particularly concerning, as the stellar
rotation period is often included in the range of potential planet orbital
periods. To robustly detect and accurately characterize low-mass planets via
Doppler planet surveys, the exoplanet community must develop statistical models
capable of jointly modeling planetary perturbations and intrinsic stellar
variability. Towards this effort, this note presents simulations of extremely
high resolution, solar-like spectra created with SOAP 2.0 (arXiv:1409.3594)
that includes multiple evolving star spots. We anticipate this data set will
contribute to future studies developing, testing, and comparing statistical
methods for measuring physical radial velocities amid contamination by stellar
variability.

  of nitric oxide","  High Rydberg states of nitric oxide (NO) with principal quantum numbers
between 40 and 100 and lifetimes in excess of 10 $\mu$s have been prepared by
resonance enhanced two-color two-photon laser excitation from the X
$^2\Pi_{1/2}$ ground state through the A $^2\Sigma^+$ intermediate state.
Molecules in these long-lived Rydberg states were detected and characterized
126 $\mu$s after laser photoexcitation by state-selective pulsed electric field
ionization. The laser excitation and electric field ionization data were
combined to construct two-dimensional spectral maps. These maps were used to
identify the rotational states of the NO$^+$ ion core to which the observed
series of long-lived hydrogenic Rydberg states converge. The results presented
pave the way for Rydberg-Stark deceleration and electrostatic trapping
experiments with NO, which are expected to shed further light on the decay
dynamics of these long-lived excited states, and are of interest for studies of
ion-molecule reactions at low temperatures.
